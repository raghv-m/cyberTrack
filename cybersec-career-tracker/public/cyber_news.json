Cybercriminals increasingly use them to perpetrate identity theft, data theft and fraud.&lt;/p&gt; \n&lt;p&gt;In enterprises, deepfakes can lead to serious security incidents and substantial financial losses. One &lt;a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cfodive.com/news/scammers-siphon-25m-engineering-firm-arup-deepfake-cfo-ai/716501/\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;documented attack&lt;/a&gt;, for example, saw threat actors use deepfake technology to impersonate an organization's CFO on a video call and convince a finance employee to send them $25 million.&lt;/p&gt; \n&lt;p&gt;Many corporate end users remain unaware that such attacks are even possible, making deepfake education a critical addition to security awareness training. This article presents tips and tools to help employees identify deepfakes and protect their organizations from cyberattacks and fraud.&lt;/p&gt; \n&lt;section class=\"section main-article-chapter\" data-menu-title=\"7 tips to spot a deepfake\"&gt;\n &lt;h2 class=\"section-title\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;7 tips to spot a deepfake&lt;/h2&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Users should be alert for the following imperfections, inconsistencies and oddities, which often appear in deepfake images, videos and audio recordings and streams.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;h3&gt;1. Facial and body movements&lt;/h3&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Although deepfake technology is rapidly improving, it often fails to produce facial expressions and body movements that appear human-like and natural under scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;When viewing images of people with inhuman qualities, the brain generates a negative emotional response -- dubbed the &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/uncanny-valley\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;uncanny valley&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Urge employees to heed that instinct, as it might serve as the only indicator that they are viewing deepfake content.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;h3&gt;2. Lip-sync detection&lt;/h3&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Lip movements that don't match the corresponding voice might suggest deepfake activity, due to altered audio and synchronization issues.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;h3&gt;3. Inconsistent -- or lack of -- eye blinking&lt;/h3&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Currently, AI struggles to simulate natural eye blinking. As a result, deepfake algorithms often produce inconsistent blinking patterns or eliminate eye blinking altogether.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;h3&gt;4. Irregular reflections or shadowing&lt;/h3&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Deepfake algorithms often fail to realistically depict shadows and reflections that make sense in the context of the image. Look closely at reflections and shadows on surrounding surfaces, in backgrounds and even within participants' eyes to see if they appear natural or set off alarm bells.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;h3&gt;5. Pupil dilation&lt;/h3&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;AI typically does not alter the diameter of subjects' pupils, which can sometimes lead to eyes that appear off. This is especially evident if the subject's eyes are focusing on objects that are either close or far away, or should be adjusting to multiple light sources. If you are watching subjects whose pupils aren't dilating naturally, that's a sign that the video is a deepfake.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;h3&gt;6. Incongruent skin and facial features&lt;/h3&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Subjects of deepfakes often exhibit strangely uniform skin, lacking natural variation in texture and coloration that comes from wrinkles, freckles, sunspots, moles, scars and shadows. Additionally, facial features might not seem cohesive -- perhaps the person's eyes look much younger than their skin and hair, or vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;h3&gt;7. Audio oddities&lt;/h3&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Voices that sound unnaturally flat, repetitive or glitchy should raise suspicion. Similarly, those that fail to respond to changes in tone, in the case of a real-time conversation, could be deepfake-generated. Some deepfakes also have obviously artificial background noise.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;div class=\"imagecaption alignLeft\"&gt;\n  &lt;img src=\"https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineimages/how_to_spot_a_deep_fake-f.png\" alt=\"Graphic illustrating what to look for to detect a deepfake\"&gt;\n &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;                  \n&lt;section class=\"section main-article-chapter\" data-menu-title=\"How to detect fake content with AI\"&gt;\n &lt;h2 class=\"section-title\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;How to detect fake content with AI&lt;/h2&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;As deepfake creation technologies continue to improve, it will become more difficult to determine if content has been altered. But &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/feature/Types-of-deepfake-detection-technology-and-how-they-work\"&gt;AI can also be used to detect AI-generated deepfakes&lt;/a&gt;. And the good news here is, even as deepfake creation evolves, so too will AI-powered deepfake detection technologies.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Several deepfake detection tools are available today that ingest large sets of deepfake images, video and audio. Through machine learning and deep learning, the data is analyzed to identify unnatural patterns that signify the content has been artificially created.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;The following are two additional ways that AI can be used to automatically spot deepfakes:&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;ol class=\"default-list\"&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source analysis.&lt;/b&gt; Identifying the source of a multimedia file can be a giveaway that it has been altered. The challenge is that file source analysis is a daunting task when using manual methods. Deepfake detection algorithms can respond much more thoroughly and rapidly as they analyze file metadata to ensure a video is completely unaltered and authentic.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Background video consistency checks.&lt;/b&gt; It used to be easy to identify a deepfake by its background. But, today, AI tools have progressed to a point where they are increasingly capable of altering backgrounds so they look complexly authentic. Deepfake detectors can pinpoint altered backgrounds by performing highly granular checks at multiple points to identify changes that might not be picked up by the human eye.&lt;/li&gt; \n &lt;/ol&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Alissa Irei is senior site editor of Informa TechTarget Security.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Andrew Froehlich is founder of InfraMomentum, an enterprise IT research and analyst firm, and president of West Gate Networks, an IT consulting company.

The bug could allow a low-privileged local user to elevate themselves to full system control or induce denial-of-service conditions on corporate machines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>JumpCloud’s agent is widely used in enterprise environments as part of its cloud-based Directory-as-a-service platform, managing device access and remote support features across Windows endpoints. According to XM Cyber’s Hillel Pinto, attackers only need a local foothold to exploit the flaw, generally <a href=\"https://www.csoonline.com/article/3970094/cybercriminals-switch-up-their-top-initial-access-vectors-of-choice.html\">obtainable</a> from phishing, remote support sessions, or developer machines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Systems running Remote Assist for Windows before version 0.317 are vulnerable and need to be updated immediately to mitigate risks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"privileged-uninstall-in-a-untrusted-temp-space\">Privileged uninstall in a untrusted temp space</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The flaw, tracked as <a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-34352\">CVE-2025-34352</a> and rated at CVSS 8.5 out of 10, highlights risks from improper handling of privileged operations on Windows endpoints. During uninstall or update operations, the JumpCloud agent triggers the Remote Assist uninstaller with system-level privileges, the highest possible authority in Windows.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, that routine performs create, write, execute, and delete actions on files in a user-writable %TEMP% subdirectory without validating the trustworthiness of the path or resetting access control lists.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because the uninstaller performs privileged file operations inside a user-controlled %TEMP% directory, a low-privileged attacker can abuse those operations to overwrite or delete protected system files.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“What we have is a JumpCloud process with NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM privileges that is deleting, writing, and executing a file with a predictable filename from an untrusted path,” Pinto said in a blog <a href=\"https://xmcyber.com/blog/jumpshot-xm-cyber-uncovers-critical-local-privilege-escalation-cve-2025-34352-in-jumpcloud-agent/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">post</a>. “The core of the exploit involves Link Following, utilizing mount points and symbolic links to redirect the privileged I/O operation.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"full-privilege-escalation-and-denial-of-service\">Full privilege escalation and denial of service</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The vulnerability opens two primary exploitation vectors with significant operational impact: full privilege escalation to system level, and denial of service (DoS).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By manipulating filesystem paths and leveraging race conditions, an attacker can redirect the uninstaller’s operations to delete or overwrite protected installer configuration targets, ultimately triggering techniques that give them a system-level command prompt. System access on an enterprise endpoint effectively grants control over policy enforcement, credential theft paths, and lateral movement capabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alternatively, attackers can get the privileged process to write arbitrary data to sensitive system files (such as drivers), corrupting them and forcing blue screen of death (<a href=\"https://www.csoonline.com/article/2589942/blue-screen-of-death-strikes-crowd-of-crowdstrike-servers.html\">BSOD</a>) conditions. This not only knocks machines offline but can require substantial remediation effort, particularly across distributed fleets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pinto said that updating to JumpCloud Remote Assist for Windows version 0.317.0 or later will remediate this issue. “My team and I responsibly disclosed the vulnerability to JumpCloud, which confirmed the findings and promptly released a patch.” While >NIST</span>’s National Vulnerability Database (NVD) marks the flaw as fixed and references the JumpCloud Agent release notes for patching, there is currently no note dedicated to the flaw on the page or on JumpCloud’s support site. JumpCloud did not immediately respond to CSO’s request for comments.</p>\n</div></div></div></div>",

Die Angreifer nutzen aber auch bekannte Schwachstellen wie CVE-2022-26318 in WatchGuard Firebox- und XTM-Geräten, CVE-2021-26084 und CVE-2023-22518 in Confluence oder CVE-2023-2753 in Veeam Backup aus.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laut den von Amazon gesammelten Telemetriedaten hat sich die Gruppe in diesem Jahr jedoch stark auf Fehlkonfigurationen konzentriert und sich von Zero-Day- oder N-Day-Schwachstellen abgewendet. Die Hauptziele waren demnach Enterprise Router und Routing-Infrastrukturen, VPN-Konzentratoren und Remote-Access-Gateways, Netzwerkmanagement-Appliances, Kollaborations- und Wiki-Plattformen sowie Cloud-basierte Projektmanagementsysteme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>„Diese taktische Anpassung ermöglicht die gleichen operativen Ergebnisse, nämlich das Sammeln von Anmeldedaten und laterale Bewegungen innerhalb der Online-Dienste und Infrastrukturen der Opfer, während gleichzeitig die Entdeckungsgefahr und der Ressourcenaufwand der Akteure reduziert werden“, so die Security-Spezialisten.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"verbindungen-zu-sandworm-und-curly-comrades\">Verbindungen zu Sandworm und Curly COMrades</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Die Telemetriedaten zeigen, dass es Überschneidungen zwischen der Infrastruktur der Gruppe und Sandworm gibt, die auch als APT44 und Seashell Blizzard bekannt ist und mit dem russischen Militärgeheimdienst GRU in Verbindung steht. Zudem besteht ein Zusammenhang mit einer Gruppe, deren Aktivitäten in der Vergangenheit von Bitdefender unter dem Namen <a href=\"https://www.csoonline.com/article/4085272/russian-apt-abuses-windows-hyper-v-for-persistence-and-malware-execution.html\" target=\"_blank\">Curly COMrades</a> dokumentiert wurden.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Es könnte sich jedoch um zusammenarbeitende Untergruppen innerhalb des GRU handeln: Während die von Amazon verfolgte Gruppe den ersten Zugriff und die laterale Bewegung übernimmt, stellt Curly COMrades die Persistenz des Hosts durch seine benutzerdefinierten Malware-Implantate CurlyShell und CurlCat sicher.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amazon entdeckte Angriffe auf Netzwerk-Edge-Geräte von Kunden, die auf AWS-EC2-Instanzen gehostet werden. Dabei stellten die Angreifer über von ihnen kontrollierte IP-Adressen dauerhafte Verbindungen her. Dies deutet auf einen interaktiven Zugriff auf die kompromittierten Geräte hin.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abgriff-von-anmeldedaten\">Abgriff von Anmeldedaten</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Die Sicherheitsforscher beobachteten auch Credential-Replay-Angriffe auf andere Online-Dienste der Opfer, bei denen gestohlene Domain-Anmeldedaten nach der Kompromittierung von Netzwerk-Edge-Geräten verwendet wurden. Das Amazon-Team geht davon aus, dass die Täter Anmeldedaten sammeln, indem sie die Funktionen der kompromittierten Geräte zur Erfassung und Analyse des Datenverkehrs nutzen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>„Die zeitliche Lücke zwischen der Kompromittierung der Geräte und den Authentifizierungsversuchen gegen die Dienste der Opfer deutet eher auf eine passive Sammlung als auf einen aktiven Diebstahl von Anmeldedaten hin“, heißt es im Forschungsbericht.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beim Abfangen des Netzwerkverkehrs gehen die Angreifer ähnlich vor wie Sandworm. Die gezielte Ausrichtung auf Netzwerk-Edge-Geräte versetzt sie dabei in die Lage, Anmeldedaten während der Übertragung abzufangen.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"tipps-zum-schutz-fur-kritis-betreiber\">Tipps zum Schutz für KRITIS-Betreiber</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Die Gruppe konzentriert sich stark auf den Energiesektor. Dazu zählen zudem MSSPs (Managed Security Service Provider) mit Kunden aus der Energieversorgung. Die Angreifer haben jedoch auch Technologie- und Cloud-Dienstleister sowie TK-Anbieter in mehreren Regionen ins Visier genommen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amazon rät Unternehmen, ihre Netzwerk-Edge-Geräte auf unauthorisierte Packet Capture Files oder -Dienstprogramme zu überprüfen. Zudem wird empfohlen, Gerätekonfigurationen zu checken und Verwaltungsschnittstellen zu isolieren sowie eine Multi-Faktor-Authentifizierung zu implementieren.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unternehmen sollten außerdem Authentifizierungsprotokolle prüfen und Authentifizierungsversuche aus unerwarteten geografischen Standorten überwachen. Zudem empfiehlt sich, eine Anomalieerkennung für Authentifizierungsmuster für alle Online-Dienste zu implementieren. Auch die Verwendung von Klartextprotokollen, die Anmeldedaten während der Übertragung offenlegen könnten, sollte kontrolliert werden.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Der Amazon-Bericht enthält zudem Indikatoren für Kompromittierungen im Zusammenhang mit dieser Angriffskampagne sowie spezifische Sicherheitsempfehlungen speziell für AWS-Umgebungen.

CASBs can be deployed on-premises or in the cloud; as a hardware appliance or software-only, as a proxy, reverse proxy, or through specific APIs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enterprises have untold numbers of endpoints, both managed (corporate-owned devices) and unmanaged (devices owned by employees or third-party contractors). Endpoints can be on-premises or remote. And endpoints can include internet of things (IoT) devices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[ Download our editors’ PDF <a href=\"https://us.resources.csoonline.com/resources/download-our-cloud-access-security-broker-casb-enterprise-buyers-guide/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><u>cloud access security broker (CASB) enterprise buyer’s guide</u></a> today! ]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"in-this-buyers-guide\">In this buyer’s guide:</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Cloud access security brokers (CASBs) explained</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Why enterprises need cloud access security brokers (CASBs)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>What to look for in a cloud access security broker (CASB) tool</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Core cloud access security broker (CASB) services</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Leading cloud access security broker (CASB) vendors</li>\n\n\n\n<li>What to ask before cloud access security broker (CASB) tool</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Essential reading</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In a multicloud environment, each endpoint could connect to multiple cloud resources over the course of a single day — productivity apps (like Microsoft 365), SaaS apps (like Salesforce and Workday), collaboration apps (like Slack and Zoom), and cloud storage (like Amazon Web Services and Dropbox). Not to mention homegrown apps that have been migrated to the cloud, or apps that have been developed in the cloud (that is, cloud-native).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>CASBs sit between an organization’s endpoints and cloud resources, acting as a gateway that monitors everything that goes in or out, providing visibility into what users are doing in the cloud, enforcing access control policies, and looking out for security threats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some vendors have begun incorporating additional features into core CASB functionality, such as <a href=\"https://www.csoonline.com/article/569559/what-is-dlp-how-data-loss-prevention-software-works-and-why-you-need-it.html\">data loss prevention (DLP)</a>, secure web gateway (SWG), <a href=\"https://www.csoonline.com/article/657138/how-to-choose-the-best-cloud-security-posture-management-tools.html\">cloud security posture management (CSPM)</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.csoonline.com/article/553329/user-entity-behavior-analytics-next-step-in-security-visibilty.html\">user and entity behavior analytics (UEBA)</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it is important to note that CASBs are also a key component of a broader security strategy that goes by several names:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Gartner calls that broader strategy <a href=\"https://www.networkworld.com/article/957252/10-questions-to-ask-about-secure-service-edge-sse.html\">Secure Service Edge (SSE)</a>, an integration of CASB, secure web gateway (SWG), and <a href=\"https://www.networkworld.com/article/971137/who-is-selling-zero-trust-network-access-ztna-and-what-do-you-get.html\">zero trust network access (ZTNA)</a>. According to Gartner, by 2026, 85% of organizations seeking to secure their web, SaaS, and private applications will obtain the security capabilities from a Security Service Edge (SSE) offering. The Gartner nomenclature has become the de facto standard. They and others have used a second acronym, Security Access Service Edge (SASE).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>IDC defines the category as network edge security as a service (NESaaS), with the same three core components: CASB, SWG, and ZTNA. “The network security market is in the process of a much-needed convergence trend. Security vendors have shifted from a focus on à la carte, individualized security services to a consolidated, cloud-delivered network security platform that treats individual services as optional modules,” IDC states.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-enterprises-need-cloud-access-security-brokers-casbs\">Why enterprises need cloud access security brokers (CASBs)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The original use case for CASBs was to address <a href=\"https://www.csoonline.com/article/563803/shadow-it-its-not-what-you-think.html\">shadow IT</a>. When security execs deployed their first CASB tools, they were surprised to discover how many employees had their own personal cloud storage accounts, where they squirreled away corporate data. CASB tools can help security teams discover and monitor unauthorized or unmanaged cloud services being used by employees. This has grown to also include <a href=\"https://www.csoonline.com/article/3964282/cisos-no-closer-to-containing-shadow-ais-skyrocketing-data-risks.html\">shadow AI services</a>, as more enterprise users pick various machine learning models and use personal accounts to access public-facing generative AI tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, CASBs encompass a variety of other use cases:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Data protection</strong>: The COVID-19 pandemic drove employees to remote work and applications to the cloud, where they could be more easily accessed. The pandemic has passed, and many employees have returned to the office, but those applications and that data are still in the cloud. Organizations must protect sensitive data as it moves across a hybrid cloud environment. Today’s CASB often integrates DLP functionality.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Compliance:</strong> Data privacy regulations continue to tighten. CASBs are an important tool in an organization’s overall regulatory compliance framework, enforcing data privacy policies.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Remote workforce</strong>: Regardless of the location of employees, CASBs allow enterprises to implement more consistent security standards and secure remote access to cloud resources.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Threat detection</strong>: CASBs can detect malicious activity, intrusion attempts, ransomware, and other types of security events. CASB tools can generate real-time alerts to enable quick response by security teams and feed these alerts into other security platforms to mitigate and resolve them.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-to-look-for-in-a-cloud-access-security-brokers-casb-tool\">What to look for in a cloud access security brokers (CASB) tool</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>From a purely functional perspective, there are four key features of a CASB tool:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Visibility:</strong> CASBs provide comprehensive visibility into cloud usage, user activities, and data flows.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Control:</strong> CASBs offer granular control over user permissions and data access.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Data protection:</strong> CASB solutions provide data protection capabilities to safeguard sensitive information across multiple cloud services.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Compliance:</strong> CASB tools help maintain compliance with data privacy regulations.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond those core features, organizations need to make sure the CASB tool well integrates with existing cloud services, applications, and security infrastructure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are three deployment modes: forward proxy, reverse proxy and API-based. Most experts say that API-based CASBs provide better functionality, but organizations need to make sure that the vendor’s list of application programming interface (API) connections matches up with the organization’s inventory of cloud apps.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"core-casb-services\">Core CASB services</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Take note about the use or requirements for deploying various agents with each product. This is where the CASB vendors often place their secret sauce, which could be an issue depending on how agent-friendly or agent-adverse your IT department is. For example, Skyhigh uses a single agent that functions across all three operational modes. Some of the other CASBs have multiple agents — such as for specific functional areas like antivirus, DLP, or VPN — that can get messy, not to mention tough to deal with unmanaged endpoints such as personal mobile phones and embedded devices such as internet of things controllers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following three basic services that all CASBs offer are at the core of what CASBs do and why you would buy one:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Monitor and control your most sensitive data flows</strong>: CASBs were originally designed to stem the tide of shadow IT products and to control and make SaaS applications more secure. Now they have broadened their use and can fit into a variety of situations, including operating across multiple cloud providers and mixing SaaS, mobile, and on-premises applications, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Apply uniform DLP policies across all servers and apps:</strong> As your data appetite increases, you need better ways to ensure that you aren’t leaking customer- and business-sensitive information, either through a malicious insider or inadvertently through a bad combination of security loopholes. While DLP products have been around for years, having DLP-like features in your CASB can be a nice way to track these potential weak spots, especially as more of your data moves into the cloud and is accessed by unmanaged mobile devices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Manage cloud-native encryption keys:</strong> Ideally, your CASB should automatically keep track of your encryption needs and keys so you don’t have to do this manually, and so you can encrypt more of your data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some CASB tools are better at some things than others. For example:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Bitglass has an Ajax virtual machine-like layer that handles near-real-time DLP on unmanaged devices. The only caveat is that these devices have to access data through their browsers.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Some CASBs, such as Fortra, has field-level encryption on some SaaS structured data services, which can be a handy mechanism for protecting sensitive information.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond these basics, all CASBs offer the potential to operate in one (or more) of three different modes:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Forward proxy</strong>, usually deployed with endpoint agents or VPN clients.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Reverse proxy</strong>, which doesn’t require agents and can work better for unmanaged devices.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>API control</strong>, which provides visibility into data already stored in cloud repositories or data that is used in a cloud process that never enters a corporate network.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"feature-sets-across-casb-operational-modes-vary\">Feature sets across CASB operational modes vary</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Part of the CASB evaluation challenge is understanding how the feature set extends to each operational mode if indeed the product operates in more than one mode. Broadcom’s Symantec CASB, for example, has reverse proxies just for Microsoft 365 and no other application. Meanwhile, Cisco Systems and Palo Alto Networks both offer API-only CASB products. Such differences mean you need to understand the types of protection and not just which apps are supported but how they are supported, and what is the exact API portfolio that is covered by each product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You really need the API support if you want to get granular with your CASB protection to understand the state of your public cloud security exposure and to stop any cloud-based malware too. API deployments also can trap cloud-to-cloud activities and to retrospectively inspect archived traffic flows. You will also need some level of proxying to handle application gateways and for implementing specific security policies. It pays to read the fine print and develop an appropriate test plan that will reveal the relevant features for each vendors’ product.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"nice-to-have-sets-of-casb-features\">Nice-to-have sets of CASB features:</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Conduct continuous risk assessments and compliance audits on demand:</strong> A CASB can show in a single place where a corporation has the most risk and summarizes issues that a security team can quickly focus on for suspicious behavior that other products couldn’t easily do.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Forcepoint, Netskope, and Proofpoint all have nice risk summary dashboards that you can customize to display the things you need to understand how your environment is behaving and what needs immediate attention.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Apply uniform adaptive authentication policies across all logins, servers, and apps</strong>: This should include read-only access (Gartner suggests this would be a good situation for unsanctioned SaaS services that are nonetheless needed), step-up authentication, and more granular access rights management.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Identity management and single sign-on (SSO) tools are the usual go-to reasons for these sorts of tasks, and one important trend is that more CASBs are integrating with traditional SSO products. The trick is to understand that the typical level of integration happens (usually) in reverse proxy mode only, and the SSO authentication is only passed to the CASB at the initial application login moment. This means that if you want a more complete adaptive authentication to trap when more risky behavior happens, you will probably have to stick with your dedicated SSO product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you can see, CASBs touch a lot of different existing security products across your enterprise. The challenge for successful integration is being able to understand these interactions and ensure that you overall security profile is enhanced rather than degraded with their use.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"leading-cloud-access-security-broker-casb-vendors\">Leading cloud access security broker (CASB) vendors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The list of leading CASB vendors (in alphabetical order) includes pure-play companies as well as traditional security vendors that have added CASB capabilities to their portfolios either by acquisition or through internal development. Most vendors would not share their pricing details, but we have found approximate clues on AWS and Azure marketplaces where we could.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/zero-trust/products/casb\"><strong>Cloudflare CASB</strong></a> is an add-on to their One SASE platform, using the same overall agent. There is a free version for under 50 users which allows two SaaS components, and prices start at $7/user/month above that level, with custom pricing for larger installations. The CASB product is now four years old and integrates with visibility and control of various AI services such as ChatGPT and Google Gemini. It doesn’t support reverse proxies, includes DLP and integrates with the risk scores and metadata sources available with Microsoft’s cloud services, such as with protecting Office 365 documents and emails.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cisco.com/site/us/en/products/security/cloudlock/index.html\"><strong>Cisco Cloudlock:</strong></a>Cisco Systems has had a CASB since it acquired Cloudlock back in 2016. Cisco Cloudlock is a cloud-native CASB that protects users, data, and apps with an automated approach that uses APIs to manage the risks in the cloud app ecosystem. It integrates with Cisco’s SSE platform for its protective policies and a uniform dashboard. Cloudlock uses advanced machine learning algorithms to detect anomalies. It also provides DLP functionality and targets shadow IT with policy-based controls that can block dangerous activities, depending on permissions and risk levels. It uses machine learning to produce risk scores for more than 1,300 applications along with having tools to manage AI supply chains.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.forcepoint.com/product/casb-cloud-access-security-broker\"><strong>Forcepoint ONE CASB</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Forcepoint bought Bitglass in 2021, one of the original standalone CASB vendors and a leader in Gartner’s Magic Quadrant for CASB. Forcepoint has integrated Bitglass technology with its own DLP capabilities to provide an SSE solution. Forcepoint excels in monitoring and reporting on shadow IT, and its user analytics feature is popular. The software also supports a zero-trust architecture, providing device and user authentication.

There’s a laundry list of possible features that fall within the broad CASB definition (DLP, SWG, etc.) And CASB tools themselves are part of a larger trend toward SSE and SASE platforms that include features such as ZTNA or SD-WAN. Enterprises need to identify their specific pain points — whether that’s regulatory compliance or shadow IT — and select a vendor that meets their immediate needs and can also grow with the enterprise over time. Here are the key questions to ask yourself before buying a CASB tool:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\" start=\"1\">\n<li>Do I have a good handle on what cloud services my users are accessing, including employees, contractors, and other third-parties?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Do I have a solid data classification system in place, so that I know what types of data are sensitive or mission critical?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Do I have policies in place for access control across both on-prem and cloud environments, including SaaS applications?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Do I have clear objectives? What are my priorities when shopping for a CASB?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>How will a CASB tool integrate with my existing security infrastructure such as firewalls, endpoint protection and web gateways. Examine how it will protect my entire applications’ estate, including custom-written apps. What happens as I migrate apps from on-premises to the cloud or in reverse?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Do I get DLP and SWG as part of the CASB, or are those additional modules?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>How will the purchase of a CASB tool play into my broader security roadmap that might include the adoption of SSE or SASE?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>What is the initial cost, as well as the longer-term total cost of ownership?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Do I have the budget for a new tool?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Can your product scale as my company grows?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Does your product cover all the geographic regions where I operate?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Do I have the inhouse staff to deploy and manage the tool on-premises, or should I take the cloud-based, managed service route?</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"essential-reading\">Essential reading</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.csoonline.com/article/562793/how-do-you-secure-the-cloud-new-data-points-a-way.html\">How do you secure the cloud?

        "summary": "<div id=\"remove_no_follow\">\n\t\t<div class=\"grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column\">\n\t\t\t\t\t  <div class=\"col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"article-column__content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>A US Securities and Exchange Commission committee has recommended a new rule that would mandate companies to analyze and report all AI efforts — including decisions to <em>not </em>use AI for some purposes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Attorneys who have studied the proposal note that the AI rule — just like <a href=\"https://www.csoonline.com/article/1247504/how-us-sec-legal-actions-put-cisos-at-risk-and-what-to-do-about-it.html\">the SEC’s cybersecurity rule</a> from about two years ago — won’t technically require anything to be reported that wouldn’t have already required reporting. The new rule refers only to material AI efforts and ever since the creation of the SEC some 90 years ago, anything material has always required disclosure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But they theorize that the SEC committee believes that many public-company boards and their senior executives don’t fully understand the scope and potential impact of their various AI efforts. The new rule would force those executives to create committees and to formally review all AI decisions, potentially unearthing material issues that would otherwise not have occurred to those executives. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cybersecurity consultant <a href=\"https://formergov.com/directory/brianlevine\">Brian Levine</a>, a former federal prosecutor who today serves as executive director of FormerGov, argues that this extra focus could make a significant difference for many enterprises. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It will help focus people. It puts it in front of everyone who needs to be thinking about AI,” Levine said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for requiring companies to examine and disclose where they are either <em>not </em>using or where they might be underinvesting compared to rivals, Levine said that could help executives understand “that there is a risk that our implementation of AI may not keep up with stakeholders and competitors.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/files/sec-iac-artificial-intelligence-recommendation-111825.pdf\">proposed rule</a> comes from the SEC Investor Advisory Committee (IAC) and was discussed during the Dec. 4 IAC meeting. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"companies-can-write-their-own-definitions-of-ai\">Companies can write their own definitions of AI</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Another controversial aspect of the proposed rule is that it fails to define AI, instead instructing companies to write their own definitions. Some legal experts have suggested that the committee didn’t literally want companies to evaluate all uses of AI, given that the technology dates back to the 1950s and exists in some form in just about every piece of software that businesses use. They more likely intended for such evaluations to focus on relatively recent AI popularizations, especially generative AI and agentic AI. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under the proposed rule, companies would “self-define what they mean by artificial intelligence and then rely on that definition throughout its disclosures in describing AI-related risks, their AI deployment strategy if any and capital expenses and R&amp;D expenditures related to the implementation and deployment of AI, amongst other material information.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://jnylaw.com/our-staff/monica-j-washington-rothbaum/\">Monica Washington Rothbaum</a>, a senior attorney with J&amp;Y Law, said that it would be “risky for a company to define AI differently” because it makes “apple to apple” investor comparisons difficult if not impossible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Requiring companies to disclose AI-related risks is a smart move. But letting each company define AI however they see fit is a loophole waiting to be exploited. Without a consistent baseline, you risk turning disclosures into PR spin rather than meaningful accountability,” Rothbaum said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Rothbaum does find value in forcing companies to disclose where management has opted to not use AI or to use it less than they might have otherwise. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Under-disclosing material risks like reliance on flawed AI models can expose companies to liability when things go wrong. Failing to invest in AI responsibly could also lead to competitive disadvantages that shareholders deserve to know about,” Rothbaum said. “This isn’t theoretical. AI is already shaping the way we look at hiring, customer service, and security. These are core operations that can affect a company’s value. If you can’t clearly explain how your AI decisions are made and who’s accountable for making them, then you’re already behind. Transparency like that has to be the cost of doing business today.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://kennyhertzperry.com/attorneys/braden-perry\">Braden Perry</a>, a litigation, regulatory, and government investigations attorney with law firm Kennyhertz Perry, is not a fan of the proposed rule because he sees it unlikely to help investors make decisions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Asked the probability that such a rule would deliver useful information to investors and potential investors, Perry said, “None. In terms of an overall understanding from a shareholder, there will likely be zero usable information.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"will-filing-reveal-anything-useful\">Will filing reveal anything useful?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This concern is partly based on the many SEC cybersecurity filings that have used boilerplate language — and use SEC exemptions to reveal nothing specific.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Perry, the key part of the AI definition portion is that the definition — once used — has to be used consistently throughout all filings. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Adopt a clear, enterprise-wide definition of AI and use it consistently across SEC filings, internal policies, and marketing, so you do not redefine the term to suit the story you want to tell in a given quarter,” Perry said. “The IAC recommendation explicitly contemplates requiring issuers to define what they mean by AI, in part because inconsistent definitions are already making disclosures hard for investors to compare. Allowing companies to define AI themselves is a double-edged sword, since it can either promote honest, business-specific clarity or invite opportunistic word games.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some attorneys suggested that companies should be careful about AI phrasing or face potential actions from the SEC and the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC). </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>“</strong>Be very cautious about AI marketing. The SEC has already shown, through its AI washing enforcement actions, that it is willing to charge firms that exaggerate their AI capabilities or mislead investors about how embedded AI is in their products and processes,” Perry said. “A disclosure regime that asks companies to explain where AI is used, how it is governed, and how it affects operations will only make it easier for the SEC to test whether those claims are real.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/lexireese/\">Lexi Reese</a>, CEO of AI vendor Lanai, also expressed concern about allowing companies to write their own AI definitions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Giving companies the freedom to define AI may reduce short-term compliance friction, but it creates exactly the kind of fragmented, incomparable disclosure environment that leaves investors guessing,” Reese said. “If one company calls an autonomous decision system AI and another calls the same thing a data-driven tool, their disclosures will look compliant while describing two different universes of risk.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>AI specialist <a href=\"https://www.sans.org/profiles/rob-lee\">Rob Lee</a>, chief of research for the cybersecurity training firm the SANS Institute, said the rule might prove helpful in raising board and C-level awareness about what companies are actually doing with AI. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But as with the earlier SEC cybersecurity rule, Lee said he was unhappy that the rule includes “a massive number of get-out-of-jail-free cards. Who is going to actually disclose anything? What are they disclosing? They don’t even mention shadow IT. How do you track unsanctioned AI use in your company?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not even all members of the IAC were happy with the rule’s phrasing. IAC member John Gulliver submitted <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/files/john-gulliver-written-statement-dissent-ai-20251204.pdf\">an official dissent </a>to the proposed rule, expressing particular concern with each company’s ability to write its own AI definition. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“These definitions would likely change from year-to-year or quarter-to-quarter. I don’t see how this benefits investors,” Gulliver wrote. But he also said that he doubted the details required are realistic. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The proposed rule would “require public companies to provide highly specific disclosures of how their use of AI impacts employees at their company and the company’s customers. It’s good that this is only required when the use of AI is financially material to the company. But unfortunately, I think this is an impossible task,” Gulliver wrote. “Does the SEC really have the AI expertise necessary to determine what these line-item disclosures should be? And how is a company supposed to know the precise impact of AI on hiring or their customers? There are many macroeconomic and industry-specific factors that affect jobs and customers. In my view, accurately isolating AI-specific impacts would be a difficult guessing game.”</p>\n</div></div></div></div>",

While it is difficult to estimate the number of devices directly vulnerable to this vulnerability, there are hundreds of thousands of Fortinet appliances accessible on the public internet through specialized search engines. This allows threat actors to opportunistically attempt exploitation against large swaths of devices at once.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Arctic Wolf’s advisory says admins who see malicious activity in their logs should assume that hashed firewall credentials stored in the exfiltrated configurations have been compromised, and reset those credentials “as soon as possible.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Tuesday, the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency added one of the vulnerabilities, <a href=\"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-59718\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CVE-2025-59718</a>, to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog.

Teams can also use automated tools to scan source code, networking data, security data and other artifacts to identify application configurations, software dependencies and hardware for the CBOM. Such tools include the following:&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;h4&gt;1. CBOMkit&lt;/h4&gt;\n &lt;ul class=\"default-list\"&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;Creates CBOMs that are machine-readable and allows companies to assess compliance.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;Scans and analyzes source code to identify cryptographic resources such as algorithms, protocols, certificates and keys.

CycloneDX CBOM Support&lt;/h4&gt;\n &lt;ul class=\"default-list\"&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;Provides a standardized format for creating inventories of algorithms, keys, certificates and protocols.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;The CycloneDX standard, developed by OWASP, includes support for CBOM development.&lt;/li&gt; \n &lt;/ul&gt;\n &lt;h4&gt;4. SandboxAQ AQtive Guard&lt;/h4&gt;\n &lt;ul class=\"default-list\"&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;Includes a discovery feature that finds cryptography across the IT environment, gathering and analyzing data from sources such as cryptographic algorithms, libraries and protocols.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;Catalogs cryptographic artifacts and their dependencies and formats them into a CBOM.

Together, SBOMs and HBOMs create a framework that enables comprehensive supply chain visibility and more effective mitigation of third-party risk.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;h3&gt;Who needs HBOMs&lt;/h3&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Any organization that relies heavily on hardware and prioritizes data security and supply chain transparency needs HBOMs, including automotive manufacturers, aerospace manufacturers, medical device manufacturers, &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/tip/Top-6-critical-infrastructure-cyber-risks\"&gt;critical infrastructure&lt;/a&gt; operators and healthcare providers.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Companies with &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/tip/Use-IoT-hardening-to-secure-vulnerable-connected-devices\"&gt;IoT deployments&lt;/a&gt; and organizations working directly or indirectly with federal agencies should also consider HBOMs. Governmental organizations, for example, might not be able to legally use hardware components produced in certain countries -- e.g., China.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;h3&gt;Key components of an HBOM&lt;/h3&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;A bill of materials (BOM) contains, at minimum, the core elements used to construct a system, including part numbers, ordering codes, part descriptions, number ordered, unit costs, extended costs and any other relevant information.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;BOMs are categorized as either single-level or multilevel. Single-level BOMs are the most widely deployed. They typically list components -- e.g., assemblies -- that comprise a finished product. For example, a single-level BOM for a server might look like this:&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Server HBOM&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;ul class=\"default-list\"&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;Cabinet assembly.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;Motherboard assembly.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;CPU/memory assembly.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;Power supply assembly.&lt;/li&gt; \n &lt;/ul&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;BOMs that provide additional detail across all subassemblies are known as &lt;i&gt;multilevel BOMs&lt;/i&gt;. For example:&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Server HBOM&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;ul class=\"default-list\"&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;Cabinet assembly. \n   &lt;ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\" class=\"default-list\"&gt; \n    &lt;li&gt;Top.&lt;/li&gt; \n    &lt;li&gt;Base.&lt;/li&gt; \n    &lt;li&gt;Fasteners.&lt;/li&gt; \n   &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;Motherboard assembly. \n   &lt;ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\" class=\"default-list\"&gt; \n    &lt;li&gt;Board.&lt;/li&gt; \n    &lt;li&gt;Device jacks.&lt;/li&gt; \n   &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;CPU/memory assembly. \n   &lt;ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\" class=\"default-list\"&gt; \n    &lt;li&gt;CPU.&lt;/li&gt; \n    &lt;li&gt;Memory.&lt;/li&gt; \n   &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;Power supply assembly. \n   &lt;ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\" class=\"default-list\"&gt; \n    &lt;li&gt;Power supply.&lt;/li&gt; \n    &lt;li&gt;Power cord.&lt;/li&gt; \n   &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; \n &lt;/ul&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Again, IT and security practitioners can use both automated tools and simple spreadsheets to generate BOMs. Some &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searcherp/definition/ERP-enterprise-resource-planning\"&gt;ERP&lt;/a&gt; or manufacturing resource planning (MRP) systems also include BOM modules. The ERP or MRP systems can then use the BOM data for planning, change management and other functions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;",

        "title": "Wireless security: Differences between WEP, WPA, WPA2, WPA3",
        "summary": "&lt;p&gt;In wireless security, passwords are only half the battle. Choosing the proper level of&amp;nbsp;encryption&amp;nbsp;is just as vital, and the right choice determines whether your wireless LAN is a house of straw or a resilient fortress.&lt;/p&gt; \n&lt;p&gt;Wireless security protocols have evolved over time to address issues, enhance compatibility and strengthen security compared to their predecessors. Wired Equivalency Protocol (WEP) is the original wireless standard developed by the &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/reference/IEEE-802-Wireless-Standards-Fast-Reference\"&gt;IEEE&lt;/a&gt; in 1997 to provide a security standard for wireless networks. Being new for its time, WEP had several security vulnerabilities that were later addressed in 2004, when Wi-Fi Alliance released Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) as its successor. WPA built upon WEP by addressing its security flaws.&lt;/p&gt; \n&lt;p&gt;WPA was more of a temporary standard used to address the latter's issues, as it soon became obsolete in 2004 in favor of WPA2, a faster and more secure protocol. WPA2 was a long-term standard that remained the most dominant security protocol until 2018, when Wi-Fi Alliance introduced &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/WPA3\"&gt;WPA3&lt;/a&gt;. Although WPA3 is the latest wireless security standard, most organizations continue to use WPA2.&lt;/p&gt; \n&lt;section class=\"section main-article-chapter\" data-menu-title=\"Why wireless encryption matters for enterprises\"&gt;\n &lt;h2 class=\"section-title\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Why wireless encryption matters for enterprises&lt;/h2&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=\"_Hlk216112300\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Encryption is the process of converting data into ciphertext that requires the proper keys for decryption, making it difficult to decode. Encryption happens at many layers. Business applications and web commerce are all encrypted, whether using an encrypted Wi-Fi connection or a VPN, so wireless network encryption is arguably less significant than it once was.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Wi-Fi encryption, in addition to the application-specific encryption in use, provides a comprehensive security baseline for all client devices. This prevents unencrypted applications from posing a security risk. &lt;a name=\"_Hlk216112580\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Encryption also helps make the WLAN environment more secure from a topology perspective, as a defense against other potential vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;   \n&lt;section class=\"section main-article-chapter\" data-menu-title=\"How unsecured wireless networks create risks\"&gt;\n &lt;h2 class=\"section-title\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;How unsecured wireless networks create risks&lt;/h2&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Wireless networks require security protocols to ensure they remain secure, efficient and are compatible between various devices. Wireless networks without these standards could potentially face multiple security risks, such as the following:&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;ul class=\"default-list\"&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Compromised data. &lt;/b&gt;An unsecured network is at risk of being compromised by internal or external threat actors seeking to steal data, &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/answer/How-to-prevent-network-sniffing-and-eavesdropping\"&gt;eavesdrop&lt;/a&gt; or perform other malicious activities. Anyone within range can intercept the radio waves carrying Wi-Fi traffic without the need to access physical hardware directly.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Expanded attack surface. &lt;/b&gt;Threat actors can use unsecured wireless networks as a point of vulnerability to gain access to the broader enterprise network. Encryption doesn't necessarily fix this problem, but attackers who see a WLAN with outdated encryption protocols in place might attempt to exploit other weak spots in the wireless network.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Malware distribution.&lt;/b&gt; Hackers who gain access to the network can distribute viruses, ransomware or other malware across devices connected to it. This can lead to data breaches that create &lt;ins datetime=\"2025-12-09T16:59\" cite=\"mailto:Darah,%20Deanna\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/feature/The-effects-of-network-downtime-and-ways-to-fix-it\"&gt;network downtime&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/ins&gt; and lead to financial loss for the organization.&lt;/li&gt; \n &lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;   \n&lt;section class=\"section main-article-chapter\" data-menu-title=\"How each wireless security protocol works\"&gt;\n &lt;h2 class=\"section-title\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;How each wireless security protocol works&lt;/h2&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Most wireless APs come with the ability to enable one of four wireless encryption standards:&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;ol class=\"default-list\"&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP).&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA).&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;WPA2.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;WPA3.&lt;/li&gt; \n &lt;/ol&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;WEP is the first generation of wireless security protocols, followed by WPA. However, organizations should avoid these older WLAN security standards, as they have been deprecated. Not only are WEP and WPA easily crackable by commoditized applications, but they also indicate that the client devices restricted to them are outdated and could &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/tip/Three-ways-to-measure-wireless-network-performance\"&gt;jeopardize WLAN performance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;figure class=\"main-article-image full-col\" data-img-fullsize=\"https://www.techtarget.com/rms/onlineimages/networking-wireless_security_cheat_sheet-f.png\"&gt;\n  &lt;img data-src=\"https://www.techtarget.com/rms/onlineimages/networking-wireless_security_cheat_sheet-f_mobile.png\" class=\"lazy\" data-srcset=\"https://www.techtarget.com/rms/onlineimages/networking-wireless_security_cheat_sheet-f_mobile.png 960w,https://www.techtarget.com/rms/onlineimages/networking-wireless_security_cheat_sheet-f.png 1280w\" alt=\"Comparison chart of WEP, WPA, WPA2 and WPA3\" height=\"310\" width=\"560\"&gt;\n  &lt;figcaption&gt;\n   &lt;i class=\"icon pictures\" data-icon=\"z\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Compare the different wireless encryption standards to learn how they work and if you should use them.\n  &lt;/figcaption&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"main-article-image-enlarge\"&gt;\n   &lt;i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"w\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n &lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;     \n&lt;section class=\"section main-article-chapter\" data-menu-title=\"How WPA2 works\"&gt;\n &lt;h2 class=\"section-title\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;How WPA2 works&lt;/h2&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;As the successor to WPA, WPA2 was ratified by the IEEE in 2004 as 802.11i. WPA2's strength comes from using &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/Advanced-Encryption-Standard\"&gt;Advanced Encryption Standard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/CCMP-Counter-Mode-with-Cipher-Block-Chaining-Message-Authentication-Code-Protocol\"&gt;Counter Mode with Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol&lt;/a&gt;, an authentication mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;ul class=\"default-list\"&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;AES. &lt;/b&gt;Developed by the U.S. government to protect classified data, AES comprises three symmetric block ciphers. Each cipher encrypts and decrypts data in blocks of 128 bits using 128-, 192- and 256-bit keys, relying on the increased processing power of modern Wi-Fi hardware and client devices.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;CCMP&lt;/b&gt;. Protects data confidentiality by allowing only authorized network users to receive data. It uses cipher block chaining message authentication code to ensure message integrity.&lt;/li&gt; \n &lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;   \n&lt;section class=\"section main-article-chapter\" data-menu-title=\"KRACK vulnerability exposes WPA2 flaws\"&gt;\n &lt;h2 class=\"section-title\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;KRACK vulnerability exposes WPA2 flaws&lt;/h2&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;WPA2 was a significant step forward in Wi-Fi security, but two major flaws eventually emerged:&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;ol class=\"default-list\"&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;The key exchange used in WPA2 has inherent weaknesses that make it a poor fit for sensitive data.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/tip/Why-WPA2-PSK-can-be-a-security-risk-even-with-an-uncracked-key\"&gt;WPA2-Personal&lt;/a&gt;, which uses preshared keys, is only as strong as the PSK password used to secure it.&lt;/li&gt; \n &lt;/ol&gt;\n &lt;h3&gt;KRACK vulnerability&lt;/h3&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;WPA2 has a major drawback known as the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/answer/How-does-the-KRACK-vulnerability-use-encryption-keys\"&gt;key reinstallation attack (KRACK) vulnerability&lt;/a&gt;, which exploits the reinstallation of wireless encryption keys.

As a result, it affects all WPA2 implementations.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Industry analysts widely acknowledged KRACK as a serious WPA2 security flaw. The finding prompted technology providers to quickly roll out software patches to mitigate risk until the arrival of the next generation of wireless security. But many experts argued the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/news/450428414/KRACK-WPA2-vulnerability-might-be-more-hype-than-risk\"&gt;KRACK vulnerability would prove difficult to exploit&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;h3&gt;Weak PSKs compromise the four-way handshake&lt;/h3&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;A new Wi-Fi network connection begins with a cryptographic four-way handshake between an endpoint and AP.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;ol class=\"default-list\"&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;Both devices prove they know a preestablished authentication code -- Pairwise Master Key (PMK) in enterprise mode and PSK in personal mode -- without either one revealing it explicitly through a series of back-and-forth messages.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;The client device sends a cryptographic response to the AP to confirm that both devices generated the same encryption key.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;The AP passes a traffic encryption key to the client.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;If the endpoint doesn't acknowledge it has received the key, the AP assumes a connectivity issue, resending and reinstalling it repeatedly.&lt;/li&gt; \n &lt;/ol&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;KRACK attackers -- who must be within physical range of both the client and the network -- can trigger, capture, analyze, manipulate and replay those retransmissions until they're able to determine the key, break encryption and gain access to network data.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;The four-way handshake method also makes WPA2 networks with weak passcodes vulnerable to offline&amp;nbsp;dictionary attacks, a type of brute-force attack that involves systematically trying hundreds, thousands or millions of pre-compiled possible passwords, out of earshot of the target network.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=\"_Hlk216183840\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;An attacker could capture a WPA2 handshake, take that information offline and use a computer program to compare it against a list of likely codes. This process continues until they find a code that aligns logically with the available handshake data. Dictionary attacks are less likely to succeed against long and complex &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/tip/Top-5-password-hygiene-tips-and-best-practices\"&gt;passwords with combinations&lt;/a&gt; of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and special characters.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;div class=\"youtube-iframe-container\"&gt;\n  &lt;iframe id=\"ytplayer-0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/l71GBlds0Rs?autoplay=0&amp;amp;modestbranding=1&amp;amp;rel=0&amp;amp;widget_referrer=null&amp;amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;amp;origin=https://www.techtarget.com\" type=\"text/html\" height=\"360\" width=\"640\" frameborder=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;             \n&lt;section class=\"section main-article-chapter\" data-menu-title=\"How WPA3 works\"&gt;\n &lt;h2 class=\"section-title\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;How WPA3 works&lt;/h2&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;In 2018, Wi-Fi Alliance began certification for WPA3, the most recent and most secure wireless security standard. As of July 2020, Wi-Fi Alliance &lt;a href=\"https://www.wi-fi.org/security\"&gt;required all devices&lt;/a&gt; seeking Wi-Fi certification to support WPA3. New features and requirements include the following:&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;ul class=\"default-list\"&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Protected Management Frames. &lt;/b&gt;Required in WPA3 and optional in prior standards. PMFs help guard against eavesdropping and forging. It also standardizes the 128-bit cryptographic suite and disallows obsolete security protocols. WPA3-Enterprise has optional 192-bit security encryption and a 48-bit IV for heightened protection of sensitive corporate, financial and governmental data.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stronger CCMP. &lt;/b&gt;WPA3-Personal uses CCMP-128 and AES-128, whereas the enterprise version with 802.1X offers stronger protection options.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;More secure cryptographic handshake. &lt;/b&gt;Replaces the legacy PSK four-way handshake with simultaneous authentication of equals. SAE eliminates the reuse of encryption keys, requiring a new code with every interaction. Without open-ended communication between AP and client or the reuse of encryption keys, cybercriminals can't easily eavesdrop or insert themselves into an exchange.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wi-Fi Easy Connect. &lt;/b&gt;Introduced by Wi-Fi Alliance alongside WPA3. Wi-Fi Easy Connect simplifies the onboarding process for IoT devices without visual configuration interfaces using a mechanism such as a QR code scan.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wi-Fi Enhanced Open.&lt;/b&gt; Safeguards connecting to public Wi-Fi networks by automatically encrypting information between each client and AP using a new unique key.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Opportunistic Wireless Encryption.&lt;/b&gt; Provides an automatic key exchange for devices that support it. OWE also offers eavesdropping-resistant encryption with no user intervention.&lt;/li&gt; \n &lt;/ul&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;WPA3 is not impervious to threats, however. WPA3 has design and implementation flaws known as Dragonblood vulnerabilities. These include two downgrade attacks, in which an attacker forces a device to revert to WPA2, and two side-channel attacks, which enable offline dictionary attacks. However, according to Wi-Fi Alliance, vendors could readily mitigate them with software upgrades.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;    \n&lt;section class=\"section main-article-chapter\" data-menu-title=\"WPA3: The most secure Wi-Fi protocol\"&gt;\n &lt;h2 class=\"section-title\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;WPA3: The most secure Wi-Fi protocol&lt;/h2&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Experts agree WPA3 is best for Wi-Fi security, as it's the most up-to-date wireless encryption protocol. Some wireless APs do not support WPA3, however. In that case, the next best option is WPA2, which is widely deployed in the enterprise space today.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=\"_Hlk216188312\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Because WEP or WPA are outdated and insecure, network administrators should replace any&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/answer/Is-there-a-difference-between-a-wireless-access-point-and-a-wireless-router\"&gt;wireless AP or router&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;that supports WEP or WPA with a newer device compatible with WPA2 or WPA3.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;   \n&lt;section class=\"section main-article-chapter\" data-menu-title=\"Best practices for Wi-Fi deployment and migration\"&gt;\n &lt;h2 class=\"section-title\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Best practices for Wi-Fi deployment and migration&lt;/h2&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;There is no single best approach to wireless security. Successful implementation begins with defining specific requirements tailored to the situation and client device capabilities. Not all environments require the most comprehensive security, the necessary infrastructure and the costs that come with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Certain situations, such as those involving PCI or HIPAA, for example, require stronger security than others. Wi-Fi security also needs to be designed for compliance where regulatory guidance is mandated. In other situations, organizations must weigh the decision to use 802.1X-based security or PSK-based encryption. This decision comes down to the ease of use and the complexity of implementation.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Organizations can secure even an open wireless network by only allowing clients to access the internet or a targeted in-house destination with secure applications.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Defining requirements is often one of the most challenging aspects of wireless security. Implementation difficulty will depend on complexity of the requirements. Organizations might find they need multiple types of security in one environment for different use cases. The choice will require ongoing periodic auditing or penetration testing, as well as monitoring for new vulnerabilities of current protocols that become obsolete.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Jessica Scarpati is a Boston-based freelance writer.

These include integrating tools such as &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/tip/SIEM-benefits-and-features-in-the-modern-SOC\"&gt;security incident and event management&lt;/a&gt; (SIEM), security orchestration, automation and response (&lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/SOAR\"&gt;SOAR&lt;/a&gt;) and extended detection and response (&lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/extended-detection-and-response-XDR\"&gt;XDR&lt;/a&gt;); automating repetitive tasks so staff can focus on more engaging work; and using &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/feature/How-AI-driven-SOC-tech-eased-alert-fatigue-Case-study\"&gt;AI-enabled tools to detect threats and prioritize alerts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; \n&lt;section class=\"section main-article-chapter\" data-menu-title=\"Signs that SOC modernization is necessary\"&gt;\n &lt;h2 class=\"section-title\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Signs that SOC modernization is necessary&lt;/h2&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;CISOs should look for growing fatigue, frustration and turnover among SecOps staff, as these are indicators that the SOC is struggling to cope. Similarly, upward trends in KPIs such as number of incidents, severity of incidents, mean time to detect, mean time to respond and mean time to recover could signal systemic problems.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;If the SOC's current performance introduces unacceptable &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/tip/5-ways-to-achieve-a-risk-based-security-strategy\"&gt;levels of cyber risk&lt;/a&gt;, consider investing in modernization initiatives to better align the security program with the organization's &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/feature/How-to-define-cyber-risk-appetite-as-a-security-leader\"&gt;cyber risk appetite&lt;/a&gt; and business objectives.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;   \n&lt;section class=\"section main-article-chapter\" data-menu-title=\"Core components of a modern SOC\"&gt;\n &lt;h2 class=\"section-title\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Core components of a modern SOC&lt;/h2&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;To modernize the SOC in a way that best meets the organization's needs, a CISO must design the right balance of people, processes, technology and facilities.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Many components of a modern SOC are familiar, such as threat hunting, vulnerability management, &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/tip/Business-continuity-vs-disaster-recovery-vs-incident-response\"&gt;disaster recovery&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/identity-access-management-IAM-system\"&gt;identity and access management&lt;/a&gt;. Others, however, are truly next-generation in their capabilities and outcomes. Consider, for example, the following.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;ul class=\"default-list\"&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;AI-enabled SecOps systems.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/feature/How-AI-threat-detection-is-transforming-enterprise-cybersecurity\"&gt;AI is turbocharging systems that detect threats&lt;/a&gt;, analyze them and mitigate or eliminate them, such as SIEM, SOAR, endpoint detection and response (EDR) and XDR. It can also support automation of routine and repetitive tasks, freeing staff to tackle more challenging and engaging projects.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Threat intelligence platforms&lt;/b&gt;. Threat intelligence platforms are services that capture, aggregate and share data on millions of security events from &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/threat-intelligence-feed\"&gt;threat intelligence feeds&lt;/a&gt; to inform threat hunting, incident response and risk analysis. They integrate with platforms such as SIEM, SOAR and XDR to help these applications recognize, prevent and respond to threats.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Security platform integration&lt;/b&gt;. Next-generation SOCs integrate multiple security platforms and tools, such as SIEM, SOAR and XDR, to present a coherent view of the entire threat landscape and support analysts in prioritizing and responding to events.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Compliance management&lt;/b&gt;. Organizations face an ever-increasing volume of cybersecurity standards and regulations. Next-gen SOCs regularly monitor all operational activities, compare them to requirements specified in relevant standards and deliver reports on compliance.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Staffing and training&lt;/b&gt;. The demand for experienced cybersecurity professionals far outstrips the supply. Modernizing SOCs and training staff on new tools can improve job satisfaction and relieve burnout, helping engage and retain team members.&lt;/li&gt; \n &lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;    \n&lt;section class=\"section main-article-chapter\" data-menu-title=\"Tips for modernizing the SOC\"&gt;\n &lt;h2 class=\"section-title\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Tips for modernizing the SOC&lt;/h2&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;To be successful, SOC modernization projects take careful planning, senior management support, smart investing and sufficient time. Consider the following best practices.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;ol class=\"default-list\"&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Understand how the current SOC operates&lt;/b&gt;. This involves assessing how well team members interact with each other, how efficiently events are processed, and how effectively preventive measures are implemented. Consider using and tracking &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/threat-intelligence-feed\"&gt;SOC KPIs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Secure senior management approval. &lt;/b&gt;This might mean preparing a business case for an updated SOC, relevant &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/tip/How-to-craft-cyber-risk-statements-that-work-with-examples\"&gt;cyber-risk statements&lt;/a&gt;, a cost-benefit analysis and a projected &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/tip/How-to-calculate-cybersecurity-ROI-for-CEOs-and-boards\"&gt;cybersecurity ROI analysis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Identify the desired level of performance&lt;/b&gt;. Determine time frames to assess and resolve events and how to improve them, establish how to improve event reporting, identify how to achieve regulatory compliance, and define procedures and processes that could benefit from automation.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prepare a project plan for the new SOC&lt;/b&gt;. Ensure senior management reviews and approves SOC project plans. Issue regular status reports.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Establish a new baseline for the SOC and how it should operate&lt;/b&gt;. Define expectations for security alerts and reports, threat analysis and resolution, threat hunting, security tool upgrades and replacements, work area configurations and integrations with company networks, systems and other resources.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Determine how the transition to a new SOC will occur&lt;/b&gt;. Assuming the existing SOC will be operational during modernization, define how and when new and upgraded systems will take over from existing platforms; the period of time that both legacy and new platforms should be in parallel operation; how training on new systems will take place; and how integration with other entities, such as the network operations center, will occur.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Evaluate various technology options&lt;/b&gt;. While new systems with greater functionality might be ideal, consider that existing systems might be upgradeable. Weigh how best to introduce new systems and upgrades to the operating environment.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Evaluate staffing requirements&lt;/b&gt;. Identify ways to deliver additional training to existing employees and assess staffing gaps.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Evaluate facility requirements&lt;/b&gt;. If the existing SOC facility is sufficient, determine if upgraded or reconfigured workstations are necessary. If adding space or relocating to a new SOC location, ensure sufficient time in the project plan for construction.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Establish plans for updating policies and procedures&lt;/b&gt;. Existing procedures for handling threat events may need revisions based on new technology, such as AI-based systems that automatically perform formerly manual activities.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Define SOC team member responsibilities&lt;/b&gt;. During the transition, each team member will likely have regular duties, as well as additional ones associated with learning and using the new systems.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Test all new and upgraded systems&lt;/b&gt;. Ensure new and upgraded systems perform as needed; this can be accomplished by using sample data from previous events.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Complete the new SOC cutover and transition&lt;/b&gt;. Perform system acceptance testing with vendors, ensure the SOC team is fully comfortable with the new technology and procedures, and ensure employees organization-wide know how to report security issues going forward.&lt;/li&gt; \n &lt;/ol&gt;\n &lt;ol start=\"3\" class=\"default-list\"&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Paul Kirvan, FBCI, CISA, is an independent consultant and technical writer with more than 35 years of experience in business continuity, disaster recovery, resilience, cybersecurity, GRC, telecom and technical writing.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;",

In addition to adding benefits to protection and anticipation in detecting cyber threats, whether with threat intelligence, incident response and EDR, SOAR solutions, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the question we must ask is how much we are looking at the risks of this emerging technology. As AI gains traction through the use of solutions like ChatGPT, Claude.ai, Meta.ai, Copilot, Gemini, Grok, among other SaaS-based solutions, it is a fact that AI is invading and taking over our routine. Those who do not adapt to this technology may be considered a piece off the board.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether it’s to record meetings and create automated summaries with Hynote.ai, or to prepare a Cyber Risk Management plan, we really have to recognize the speed and agility that AI provides to daily tasks. We already see that in some companies, where an employee decides to change jobs, the position may no longer be replaced, and the organization considers conducting studies evaluating the feasibility of replacing certain tasks with AI.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-importance-of-understanding-the-risks-behind-ai\">The importance of understanding the risks behind AI</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here comes a point of concern that perhaps some professionals are not noticing. Are we being dominated by AI? Perhaps the answer may be “Yes,” “No” or “Maybe.” However, it will depend on the degree of visibility we have of this technology; the reality is that there is a danger behind it, and so our job is to know how to prepare to remediate such risks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Should we presume where we should fit professionally and how we should prepare to maintain our employability? Given that risks of hallucinations are still feasible and occur in AI solutions, the answer to a given question may not be accurate, as the existing methods behind diffusion models used in AI training utilize code generation techniques such as “transformers” in LLMs used by most AI tools like ChatGPT, Gemini and Claude. For now, they still have limitations to validate a certain piece of data before providing the answer to the question that was entered by the requester (end user, API, etc.).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This means and indicates that it is still necessary to consider the human factor to evaluate certain responses before providing a decision that may involve relevant decision-making in the corporate and human context, such as the result of an analysis of a medical diagnosis still requires an evaluation by a specialist, or in the case of a quantitative risk assessment of a critical system. In fact, it is a point to think about!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another important question to be asked is “how far should we limit and trust an AI solution?” Certainly, as mentioned above, many results can be positive, but remembering that every organization should think and maintain caution with privacy, bias, fairness and transparency risks through the data provided, among other points, which have raised the attention of information security professionals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Basically, the execution process of an AI model is composed of 3 phases:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The data that is inserted in a request.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>This data is evaluated by a training model that involves an entire architecture.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The result of the information that will be delivered</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>From an information security point of view. That is the point that we, information security professionals, must judge in the scope of evaluation from the perspective of data security.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the market, there are already frameworks such as <a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework\">NIST RMF AI</a>, <a href=\"https://safety.google/cybersecurity-advancements/saif/\">SAIF Google</a>, <a href=\"https://www.iso.org/standard/42001\">ISO 42001,</a> <a href=\"https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/blog/2025/07/10/introducing-the-csa-ai-controls-matrix-a-comprehensive-framework-for-trustworthy-ai\">AI Control Matrix (AICM)</a> and <a href=\"https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/artifacts/ai-model-risk-management-framework\">AI Model Risk Management Framework</a> from Cloud Security Alliance (CSA), in addition to <a href=\"https://atlas.mitre.org/\">MITRE ATLAS</a> for the Threat Intelligence line and <a href=\"https://owasp.org/www-project-top-10-for-large-language-model-applications/\">OWASP Top 10 LLMs</a> for security in AI application development, which presents the main known vulnerabilities in the AI/ML field, which I intend to explore in another article.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have particularly been studying NIST RMF AI and the AI Model Risk Management Framework from CSA, and in my view, they are effective in helping to map and add AI/ML solutions to the scope of the organization’s Cyber Risk Management program. These frameworks help to understand and map the AI applications used, address risks, impacts and damages that can occur with the use of this technology in the corporate context.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"about-the-use-of-nist-ai-rmf-and-ai-control-matrix-aicm-frameworks\">About the use of NIST AI RMF and AI Control Matrix (AICM) Frameworks</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Making an agenda about the most popular frameworks, NIST AI RMF 1.0 focuses on looking at the group of people, organization and the ecosystem involved. In which they are divided into phases of</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Govern (cultivates a risk culture)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Map (context of identified risk and asset classification)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Measure (identifies, assesses and mitigates risk)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Manage (risks are prioritized according to impact)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This model allows integration with <a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework\">NIST CSF</a> for the lens of cybersecurity controls. The most interesting thing about this is that the framework is free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another model that I cannot fail to mention is the AI Control Matrix (AICM), which contains 243 control objectives divided into 18 security domains and allows evaluating all security pillars of an AI solution, specifically in a cloud environment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/artifacts/ai-controls-matrix\">AICM</a> is integrated with AI-CAIQ, which covers frameworks including BSI AIC4 Catalog, NIST AI RMF and ISO 42001. Any robust AI solution needs large processing and energy, which can only be found in data centers. For this reason, we have seen large investments by big techs in the expansion of new data centers in all regions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, deeply understanding cloud concepts and shared responsibilities is fundamental to implement an AI solution with precision, securely and that satisfies the business, leveraging the organization’s capacity against competition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a result, I have been doing some research on GenAI and especially studying these frameworks. In view of this, characterizing and visualizing the great challenge for us, cybersecurity professionals, is to establish the relevance of the connection between the teams involved in an AI project. Therefore, the connection is a priority for the project’s success and, therefore, we should not neglect the involvement of the areas of governance, cyber risk, ethics, regulatory and compliance, cybersecurity, data scientists, AI and ML developers, human Resources and infrastructure and IT operations.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"cybersecurity-professionals-need-to-be-trained\">Cybersecurity professionals need to be trained</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Another great challenge, which I emphasize, is that cybersecurity professionals need to be trained in this AI/ML technology, understanding the technical aspects of architecture, training models used, techniques such as <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/use-cases/retrieval-augmented-generation?hl=en\">RAG (retrieval-augmented generation)</a> that propose improvements in the model, and the application of the cybersecurity strategy to be judged. The eyes of the CISO and the cybersecurity team and other fronts involved must look at the importance of controls within these areas:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Data</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Infrastructure</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Model</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Application</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Assurance</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Governance</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"looking-at-the-shared-responsibility-perspective-in-cloud\">Looking at the shared responsibility perspective in cloud</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Another factor to be considered in scope: I reinforce the <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/architecture/framework/security/shared-responsibility-shared-fate\">shared responsibility</a> of AI applications in a cloud environment. The security principles of GenAI models and respective applications must consider how the AI application model will run.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here, I highlight some crucial points to establish <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/shared-responsibility\">shared responsibilities</a> in the cloud:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>GenAI as an application (Public, SaaS)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>GenAI as a platform (IaaS or PaaS)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Build your own AI application (IaaS, on premises).</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In this model, with the help of the frameworks mentioned above, it will be possible to map, order and manage risks in the AI strategy adopted regarding access control for data and training models, data management and training, prompt controls, model development, model inference, model monitoring and infrastructure.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"thinking-outside-the-box\">Thinking outside the box</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, the key point I wish to awaken readers in this article is to lead them to think about how we cybersecurity professionals are observing the risks and impacts in our environment, and how to prepare to evaluate such GenAI solutions in our realistic world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have particularly been exploring some of these known models in a cloud environment (SaaS), but I have been having a lot of fun with the Anthropic solution (claude.ai). In this model, it is possible to build robust solutions with code; you just have to be creative. As an example, I requested that it create a complete Cyber Risk Management (GRC) solution and suggested comparing it with some solutions on the market and meet best practices such as PCI-DSS, NIST, CRI, ISO 27001, etc. So that the solution created the entire back-end, only missing the front-end creation. A project that could take months can be reduced to a few months or weeks, depending on the investment and effort of the workforce involved.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"certifications-that-can-add-value-to-a-career\">Certifications that can add value to a career</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In conclusion, as I had the opportunity to participate as a contributor to the review program for the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) recently launched new certification, <a href=\"https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/education/taise\">Trusted AI Safety Expert (TAISE)</a>. I definitely recommend it for those who are interested in understanding and exploring the architecture and main protection mechanisms in AI/ML solutions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, taking into account other certifications in this area, I have also been exploring and recommending <a href=\"https://www.isaca.org/credentialing/aaism?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=aaism&amp;utm_term=cert_na_acq_branded_ext&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=22940868601&amp;gbraid=0AAAAAD_A9K9wACMjWJDefWgA6HQuljaVc\">ISACA’s AAISM</a> certification material, which in turn is very interesting from the point of view of risk governance and security in AI/ML. Nevertheless, <a href=\"https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/education/taise\">TAISE</a> brings a more comprehensive root in the technical scope that also incorporates risk management and governance in cloud environments, which is the real world. AI needs large processing and the ideal environment to run is the cloud.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, both complement each other and it is up to the professional to evaluate the best alternative and direction to follow. As the wise proverb says: “Do not abandon wisdom and knowledge, and it will guard you; love it, and it will protect you.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This article is published as part of the Foundry Expert Contributor Network.<br /></strong><a href=\"https://www.csoonline.com/expert-contributor-network/\"><strong>Want to join?</strong></a></p>\n</div></div></div></div>",

Der Exfiltrationskanal liegt in diesem Fall vollständig außerhalb der traditionellen Sicherheitskontrollen des Unternehmens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Das Problem beschränkt sich jedoch nicht nur auf VPN-Datenverkehr oder verschlüsselte Sitzungen.Laut den Erkenntnissen von Koi injiziert Urban VPN- Skripte, die immer dann aktiviert werden, wenn Benutzer mit beliebten KI-Plattformen interagieren. Dabei werden sowohl Prompts als auch Antworten erfasst, selbst wenn die VPN-Funktionen deaktiviert sind.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"versteckte-skripte-in-privatsphare\">Versteckte Skripte in „Privatsphäre”</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Neben dem Angebot eines VPN-Dienstes setzt <a href=\"https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/urban-vpn-proxy/eppiocemhmnlbhjplcgkofciiegomcon\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Urban VPN Proxy</a> „Executor”-Skripte ein, die aktiviert werden, wenn ein Benutzer im Browser KI-Chat-Plattformen wie <a href=\"https://www.csoonline.com/article/4081836/atlas-browser-exploit-ermoglicht-angriff-auf-chatgpt-speicher.html\" target=\"_blank\">ChatGPT</a>, Claude, <a href=\"https://www.csoonline.com/article/4021853/google-gemini-lucke-ermoglicht-versteckte-phishing-angriffe.html\" target=\"_blank\">Gemini</a>, Perplexity und Grok ansteuert. „Jede Plattform hat ihr eigenes dediziertes Skript – chatgpt.js, claude.js, gemini.js und so weiter”, erklären die Forscher in einem <a href=\"https://www.koi.ai/blog/urban-vpn-browser-extension-ai-conversations-data-collection\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Blogbeitrag</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Diese Skripte überschreiben wichtige Browser-Netzwerk-APIs, um alles, was ein Nutzer eingibt und empfängt, abzufangen, zu verpacken und an die Backend-Systeme von Urban VPN zu senden. Der zugrunde liegende Code überwacht kontinuierlich den Inhalt von KI-Konversationen und die zugehörigen Metadaten und lädt diese unabhängig von der VPN-Nutzung hoch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>„Die Chrome-Erweiterung hat hohe Bewertungen und ein ‚Featured‘-Abzeichen von Google, was den Nutzern ein implizites Vertrauenssignal gibt“, stellen die Security-Spezialisten fest. „Das Abzeichen von Google bedeutet, dass es eine manuelle Überprüfung bestanden hat und den von Google beschriebenen hohen Standards für Benutzererfahrung und Design entspricht“.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sowohl die Chrome- als auch die Edge-Variante der Erweiterung sind weiterhin im Chrome Web Store, beziehungsweise im Edge Add-ons Store verfügbar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Das Storefront-Marketing von Urban hebt sogar eine „KI-Schutzfunktion“ hervor, die angeblich die Eingaben der Nutzer auf sensible Daten überprüft. Koi stellte jedoch fest, dass dieser Schutzrahmen unabhängig von der Überwachungsebene funktioniert und alle KI-Interaktionsdaten exfiltriert, egal, ob die Nutzer dies wünschen oder nicht.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chats-von-acht-millionen-konten-gestohlen\">Chats von acht Millionen Konten gestohlen</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Die Forscher von Koi entdeckten, dass der Herausgeber von Urban VPN, Urban Cyber Security Inc., eng mit BiScience (B.I Science Ltd), einem Datenbroker, verbunden ist. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dessen Datenerfassungspraktiken hätten laut Koi-Bericht bereits zuvor die Sicherheitsforscher Wladimir Palant und John Tuckner von <a href=\"https://secureannex.com/blog/sclpfybn-moneitization-scheme/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Secure Annex</a> dokumentiert. Ihre Untersuchungen ergaben, dass BiScience in großem Umfang wiedererkennbare Clickstream-Daten <a href=\"https://palant.info/2025/01/13/biscience-collecting-browsing-history-under-false-pretenses/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">sammelt</a> und diese über sein SDK und Produkte wie AdClarity und Clickstream OS monetarisiert.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Auf diese Weise seien bereits hunderte Millionen KI-Konversationen erfasst und über mehrere Erweiterungen desselben Anbieters hinweg gebündelt worden, wodurch eine kombinierte Nutzerbasis von weit mehr als acht Millionen erreicht wurde.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Koi merkt an, dass die KI-Konversationsfunktion von Urban VPN im Laufe der Zeit durch Erweiterungs-Updates eingeführt wurde und sich von früheren Browsing-Telemetriedaten zu einer umfassenderen Überwachung generativer KI-Interaktionen entwickelte, als diese Tools sich zunehmend durchsetzten. Die Ergebnisse spiegeln die allgemeinere <a href=\"https://www.csoonline.com/article/4103972/ki-browser-gefahrden-unternehmen.html\" target=\"_blank\">Warnung wider, dass Browser-basierte KI-Tools</a> und -Erweiterungen zu einer unkontrollierten Risikostufe für Unternehmen werden und eher als Teil der Angriffsfläche denn als reine Komfortfunktionen betrachtet werden sollten.

I think of them every time I board a flight.  It was no different when I returned from vacation on a JetBlue flight that retraced some of the northbound path taken by a JetBlue flight some weeks earlier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The flight in question was likely also filled with vacationers, an Airbus A320 journeying from Cancún International Airport in Mexico to Newark Liberty International Airport on October 30, 2025. As <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/31/travel/jetblue-flight-cancun.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reported the next day in the New York Times</a>, passengers aboard Flight 1230 were likely dozing off two and a half hours into the flight from the Mexican resort when they were jolted to attention by a sudden drop in altitude. When the unwanted acrobatic maneuver was over, 15 or more passengers involuntarily extended their vacations at hospitals in Tampa, where the JetBlue pilots managed a successful emergency landing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>JetBlue representatives said the plane was taken out of service for inspection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are occasional commercial aviation mishaps, along with the rare disaster. For the flying public, reports of these mishaps are regular enough that a news story like this one can be safely tucked away until a broader pattern emerges. Understandably, had that been the end of the story, especially considering that it’s been Boeing planes subject to unwanted excitement of this variety since the 737 Max woes began. The plane involved in this JetBlue flight, as well as the one where I now occupied seat 23A, was an Airbus, thought to be less subject to what an FAA Expert Panel Report in February 2024 called “gaps in Boeing’s safety journey.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s <em>this</em> plane, I thought to myself. What did the ensuing investigation uncover? Mechanical failure?  Software, perhaps even malware (though very unlikely)?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a></a>The “cause”</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Times dutifully <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/28/business/airbus-software-a320-jets.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reported the results</a> of that investigation in a story they ran on November 28, 2025, the same day of my return flight to JFK. The story, adapted in part from an <a href=\"https://www.airbus.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2025-11-airbus-update-on-a320-family-precautionary-fleet-action\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Airbus press release</a>, opened with:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The European airplane maker said a recent incident had shown that “intense solar radiation may corrupt data critical to the functioning of flight controls.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The impact on the Airbus A320 fleet and the airlines that have deployed them would be widespread.  Potentially, 6,000 planes could be affected, with some requiring hardware changes, The Times reported after studying the extent to which the A320 has been chosen by airlines worldwide. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s a major impact, I thought. And then I read,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In most cases, the issue can be addressed relatively quickly by reverting to a previous software version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hold on.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a></a>“Single event upset”</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So, how often is this radiation impact occurring?  What’s the underlying physics? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It turns out that there’s a history of science story to be told.  Nobel Prize winner Victor Hess discovered the existence of cosmic rays by measuring radiation levels at higher altitudes during balloon flights. That was before World War I. By the 1960s, it was a concern for crew health in the space program. A 1975 paper identified a satellite anomaly as a “single-event upset” (SEU) caused by radiation, and by 1979, it was understood that electronics could be disrupted at sea level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By 1990, the FAA acknowledged that there was a risk to air travelers. The Airbus A320, a fly-by-wire aircraft with greater reliance on computers, was designed during a time when this phenomenon was well understood in the aeronautical engineering community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As software engineers at the time would have understood, addressing SEUs would require hardware and software features. ECC memory, for instance.  Sanity checks, too, in case a flipped bit would produce wildly out-of-range instructions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Features.  So why would rolling back to an earlier version of software be the remedy for the A320 late in 2025?  Wouldn’t features to address SEU from radiation in the current release also be present in earlier releases?  Or perhaps was there some new, innovative way to address SEU that would supersede the approaches taken in earlier releases?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a></a>Software life cycle management fundamentals</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At this point, the software quality engineer in me perked up. Somehow, the entire radiation part of the story seemed curiously irrelevant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was not to be the only one asking questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tony Fernandez is the founder of AirAsia Aviation Group. AirAsia’s current operations include a significant number of Airbus jets, and it has orders for almost 400 more Airbus aircraft. Fernandez expressed his concerns in a recent interview.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It seems a bit bizarre; it is something it [Airbus] has to look at, it’s obvious it wasn’t tested,” Fernandez <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/southeast-asia/article/3334876/airasia-boss-says-bizarre-airbus-software-glitch-good-warning-sector?module=perpetual_scroll_0&amp;pgtype=article\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">told South China Morning Post</a>. Fernandez speculated that Airbus might be stressed by commitments to meet its current goal of producing 820 planes in 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from the eye-catching radiation storyline, the surface cause was described as a problem in the Elevator Aileron Computer (ELAC 2) software, which manages the aircraft’s pitch and roll by sending commands from the pilot’s side-stick to elevators at its rear. The software rollback involved restoring a version dubbed “L103,” replacing “L104.” Thales, developer of the ELAC hardware, told Reuters that the software involved was not its responsibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The sudden nose-down movement experienced by the JetBlue passengers bound for Newark could also affect a wide variety of Airbus models, not only the A320:  multiple variations of the A319 and A321 series are also affected. <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/11/28/airbus-issues-major-a320-recall-after-flight-control-incident\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">One estimate</a> speculated that more than 3,000 A320 jets were in the air around the time of the Airbus announcement. Picture those passengers on November 28, many equipped with WiFi on board, reading about this software vulnerability and mentally reworking their safety calculations.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a></a>4 SDLC lessons. 2 inherent risks unbowed</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond sensationalized “solar radiation” or “cosmic ray” talk, there’s a serious software development life cycle (SDLC) conversation to be had at Airbus. I’d list these four main takeaways, all of them familiar:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\" start=\"1\">\n<li>Test engineering</li>\n\n\n\n<li>CI/CD and pipeline quality</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Observability</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Supply chain</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Notice that “coding” is not one of the takeaways. True, the L104 might have introduced a build packaging mistake, or a coding error, such as an accidentally deleted call to a service, misconfigured or misunderstood API parameters, or even a syntax error in the source code. These are all normal; a healthy SDLC addresses them.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Test engineering.</strong> A good test harness could simulate the out-of-band telemetry that was supposed to invoke the range checks for ELAC.  Test harnesses need to be designed and built concurrently with software, not as a separate stage.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>CI/CD and pipeline quality.</strong> You can add Change or Configuration Management to this group. Whether or not Airbus used CI/CD in its SDLC pipeline in L104, it will be moving in that direction. Something broke in the SDLC pipeline, which allowed this fundamental feature to “regress.”  The cause is unlikely to be a one-off.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Observability.</strong> I’m adding this one partly because I’m part of a small working group at IEEE working on a new version of the <a href=\"https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/2675.2/11839/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">DevOps standard</a> that will incorporate observability principles. The SEU is an excellent use case for observability because a test engineer can’t wait for a cosmic ray to strike, yet must ensure that a failure to respond to a critical SEU event can be observed. This involves more careful requirements engineering and understanding of the telemetry needed for critical features.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Supply chain.</strong> While Thales may not have been involved in the problematic release of L104, the Airbus platform includes software and hardware from many suppliers. Integration across the computing supply chain presents challenges magnified by both the safety requirements and the desired product longevity. The apparent “Not our problem” response from Thales could indicate issues with joint information and problem-solving, or even limited visibility for the third-party risk management team.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It could get worse, a lot worse. Lapses in any one of these four areas of the SDLC create opportunities for malware, a nightmare scenario for avionics.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a></a>AI to the rescue?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I worry that two inherent risks remain largely unmitigated: <em>complexity</em> and <em>specialization</em>. Managing the entire A320 feature set, or even its software bill of materials (SBOM / API-BOM), is a nontrivial undertaking. Consider that it is a product launched in 1987 with the need to support legacy hardware and software across a large installed base.  Both complexity and specialization will march steadily toward greater opacity, challenging attempts at traceability, transparency and manageability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No doubt Airbus, like the rest of us, will bring AI on board to help out — perhaps in L105. This will add both to the specialties needed and to the plane’s overall complexity.  Considering public trepidation over AI generally, at what point will more travelers feel the odds are no longer in their favor?</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This article is published as part of the Foundry Expert Contributor Network.<br /></strong><a href=\"https://www.csoonline.com/expert-contributor-network/\"><strong>Want to join?</strong></a></p>\n</div></div></div></div>",

        "title": "Android vs. iPhone: Which one is more secure?",
        "summary": "&lt;p&gt;Android and iOS devices differ in a few ways, and security is one area where these differences affect organizations most.&lt;/p&gt; \n&lt;p&gt;The choice between iPhones and Android devices has long been an issue of debate among IT departments looking to ensure data security. To find the right security approach, decision-makers should understand the unique advantages and drawbacks of each platform.&lt;/p&gt; \n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterprisedesktop/tip/Comparing-macOS-vs-Windows-security\"&gt;Apple has a reputation as the most secure option&lt;/a&gt; due to its focus on privacy, security and end-user experience. Although Google hasn't always had the same reputation, the company has also implemented strong security measures for Android in recent years. All modern Android and iOS devices support data encryption, as well as MDM commands for enforcing passcodes and secure authentication.&lt;/p&gt; \n&lt;p&gt;The main difference between iPhones and Android devices comes down to their OS ecosystems. The iOS ecosystem is closed, meaning Apple manufactures all iPhones and has firm control over the App Store, software updates and other core services. Android, on the other hand, is an open ecosystem. Several manufacturers build Android devices with different hardware and software features, which can give way to inconsistency in update timelines and system-level security features.&lt;/p&gt; \n&lt;p&gt;This difference shapes each platform's approach to three key factors in mobile security: device management, OS updates and malware.&lt;/p&gt; \n&lt;section class=\"section main-article-chapter\" data-menu-title=\"Apple device security\"&gt;\n &lt;h2 class=\"section-title\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Apple device security&lt;/h2&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;From a broad standpoint, Apple builds iPhones from the ground up with privacy and security in mind. Because its strategy centers on tightly integrated hardware and software control, it's easier for the company to enforce consistent security standards. However, this doesn't guarantee a threat-free endpoint environment. IT teams should examine iOS security features in more detail to determine how they might affect their organizations.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;h3&gt;Key security characteristics&lt;/h3&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Apple has a built-in encryption system through Secure Enclave. This hardware-based security chip protects sensitive user data, even if the device's main processor is compromised.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Automated enrollment is available when organizations use MDM and Apple Business Manager. With this zero-touch enrollment approach, IT teams can easily send devices to end users. They automatically provision into management and lock themselves into that status, even after a device reset.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;h3&gt;Device management&lt;/h3&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;With Apple Business Manager, IT administrators can enforce supervision specifically on corporate-only devices. This grants them higher-level management privileges, enabling more effective device control. Additionally, features such as User Enrollment and Managed Apple IDs offer enhanced &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchmobilecomputing/tip/Does-Apple-offer-work-profiles-for-iPhones\"&gt;separation between work and personal data&lt;/a&gt; on a device.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;h3&gt;OS updates&lt;/h3&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Apple typically rolls out iOS updates to all supported devices at the same time. This helps make sure the latest security patches, bug fixes and new features are available to users. There are many MDM tools that provide access to OS updates within the management platform, letting IT push updates to devices centrally. The centralized approach simplifies the update process and helps maintain a consistent experience across iPhones in an organization.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;h3&gt;Malware risk&lt;/h3&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;When assessing mobile malware risk, it's worth noting that Apple's closed ecosystem can contribute to a more secure environment. Apple has strict control over app distribution, and hardware limitations can significantly reduce the risk of malware infection on iPhones.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;One of Apple's major safeguards against malware -- its tightly controlled App Store -- has changed in some regions due to competition laws. A requirement of the EU's Digital Markets Act is that the company must &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchmobilecomputing/answer/How-do-competition-laws-affect-Apples-sideloading-policies\"&gt;remove its sideloading restrictions&lt;/a&gt; for users in the EU. This could make it easier for those users to download malicious apps. However, to mitigate the possible risk, Apple has also introduced new security features, such as app notarization and authorization for marketplace developers. Plus, organizations can still disable sideloading through MDM.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;In general, iOS isn't immune to threats such as phishing, spyware and zero-day exploits. IT must continue to &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchmobilecomputing/tip/How-to-protect-mobile-devices-from-malware-in-the-enterprise\"&gt;manage attack vectors&lt;/a&gt; related to user behavior, access control, network vulnerabilities and more.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;             \n&lt;section class=\"section main-article-chapter\" data-menu-title=\"Android device security\"&gt;\n &lt;h2 class=\"section-title\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Android device security&lt;/h2&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;The Android platform's overall strategy emphasizes flexibility and choice rather than vertical integration and centralized oversight. While this approach can make it appealing for certain use cases, it increases variability in some aspects of device security. Organizations should understand the latest Android security developments for an accurate view of possible threats and management complexity.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;h3&gt;Key security characteristics&lt;/h3&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Unlike iOS, the Android OS is available on a wide range of devices, and Google has a lower level of control over security updates and patches within its open source ecosystem. This has raised concerns among IT admins, especially when managing centrally with MDM, which often requires additional licensing or third-party tools.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, Android devices have made strides when it comes to security. Google has implemented several measures that make it more difficult for hackers to break into an Android smartphone. Improvements include more extensive encryption standards and the ability to perform remote wipes. Features such as &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchmobilecomputing/tip/How-to-create-a-work-profile-on-Android-devices\"&gt;work profiles&lt;/a&gt; and fully managed mode in Android Enterprise also offer greater separation and protection of corporate and personal data.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Google has also implemented its own zero-touch programs, including Android zero-touch enrollment and a partner program with Samsung Knox Mobile Enrollment.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;h3&gt;Device management&lt;/h3&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Android provides strong management functionality and offers more hardware options than Apple. This gives admins flexibility in selecting devices that suit their specific needs. Work profiles and fully managed mode for corporate-owned and BYOD use cases enable IT to separate work and personal data. The Android Enterprise Recommended program also gives IT a &lt;a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://androidenterprisepartners.withgoogle.com/devices/\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;list&lt;/a&gt; of devices that Google has certified as meeting security, performance and manageability requirements for enterprise use.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;h3&gt;OS updates&lt;/h3&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;With the introduction of Project Mainline in Android 10, the process of updating essential Android system components has become more streamlined and consistent. These changes ensure that update timelines are predictable on Android Enterprise Recommended devices.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;While the Android Enterprise Recommended list makes it easier to find devices with OS update commitments, there are instances where certain vendors might require additional maintenance packages or third-party tools to access upgrades over extended lifecycles.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;h3&gt;Malware risk&lt;/h3&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Due to its open nature and broader range of devices, Android can be more susceptible to malware attacks than iOS. However, being open source makes it easier for security researchers to report issues to help patch vulnerabilities. Additionally, Google Play Protect helps keep malicious software off users' devices by continuously scanning apps for malware.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Still, if IT teams don't manage devices appropriately, higher security risks might be present on the Android platform. &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchmobilecomputing/opinion/How-do-you-block-sideloaded-app-installation-on-iOS-or-Android\"&gt;Blocking installations&lt;/a&gt; from third-party app stores or unknown sources, for example, is critical. IT must implement strict MDM policies to prevent enterprise threats.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;figure class=\"main-article-image full-col\" data-img-fullsize=\"https://www.techtarget.com/rms/onlineimages/mobile_computing-mobile_security-f.png\"&gt;\n  &lt;img data-src=\"https://www.techtarget.com/rms/onlineimages/mobile_computing-mobile_security-f_mobile.png\" class=\"lazy\" data-srcset=\"https://www.techtarget.com/rms/onlineimages/mobile_computing-mobile_security-f_mobile.png 960w,https://www.techtarget.com/rms/onlineimages/mobile_computing-mobile_security-f.png 1280w\" alt=\"A diagram showing the top mobile security threats.\" data-credit=\"Informa TechTarget\" height=\"220\" width=\"560\"&gt;\n  &lt;figcaption&gt;\n   &lt;i class=\"icon pictures\" data-icon=\"z\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;IT teams and end users should protect against threats such as malware and unpatched OSes to ensure mobile security.\n  &lt;/figcaption&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"main-article-image-enlarge\"&gt;\n   &lt;i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"w\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n &lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;               \n&lt;section class=\"section main-article-chapter\" data-menu-title=\"Choosing iOS vs. Android for the enterprise\"&gt;\n &lt;h2 class=\"section-title\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Choosing iOS vs. Android for the enterprise&lt;/h2&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Most modern devices can provide organizations with the necessary tools and features to &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchmobilecomputing/feature/7-mobile-device-security-best-practices-for-businesses\"&gt;ensure mobile security&lt;/a&gt;. When deciding what device is best for an organization and its end users, admins should consider what device features and capabilities are essential, as well as what the end-user experience should look like on a day-to-day basis. Then, IT should manage them centrally with MDM.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;While the prevailing notion that the iPhone offers superior security carries some weight, Android's security posture has been catching up. The iPhone has several benefits for IT, such as streamlined provisioning and enhanced UX. At the same time, Android provides strong management and security controls, along with a wide range of hardware options. With proper management and the right MDM policies in place, both iPhone and Android can be highly secure.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;   \n&lt;section class=\"section main-article-chapter\" data-menu-title=\"Best practices for enterprise mobile security\"&gt;\n &lt;h2 class=\"section-title\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Best practices for enterprise mobile security&lt;/h2&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Both iPhones and Android phones have their strengths and weaknesses regarding security and UX workflows. As a result, IT must put comprehensive security policies in place, regardless of the platform. An organization's device management and initiatives, such as zero-touch enrollment, are crucial in determining the device's overall security and adoption within the organization.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;h3&gt;Understand iOS and Android security fundamentals&lt;/h3&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;No matter what an organization's device fleet looks like, IT professionals should know how to handle security for both mobile OSes. Between BYOD policies and &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterprisedesktop/tip/How-to-deal-with-unmanaged-devices-in-the-enterprise\"&gt;unmanaged devices on corporate networks&lt;/a&gt;, Android and iOS can each play a role in the potential risk of data theft or leakage.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;h3&gt;Implement MDM&lt;/h3&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Beyond each platform's security features, how software like MDM manages devices is vital to cybersecurity. MDM tools let organizations secure their mobile devices and data through policy implementation. Organizations can then control user access to corporate applications, enforce strong password requirements, enable device encryption and more.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;It's not just a question of which platform is more secure; it's a question of how each platform works with MDM tools to protect enterprise data.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Editor's note:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt; This article was originally written by Michael Goad in September 2023.

The underlying code continuously monitors AI conversation content and related metadata, and uploads it regardless of VPN use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Chrome extension carries high ratings and a “Featured” badge by Google, giving users an implicit trust signal, the researchers noted. “The badge from Google means it had passed manual review and met what Google describes as a high standard of user experience and design,” they said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google did not immediately respond to CSO’s request for comments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both Chrome and Edge variants of the extension remain live on the Chrome Web Store and the Edge Add-ons store, respectively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Urban’s storefront marketing even highlights an “AI protection” feature that claims to check user prompts for sensitive data. But Koi found that this protective framing runs independently of the surveillance layer, exfiltrating all AI interaction data whether users want it collected or not.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"crooks-stole-chats-from-8-million-accounts\">Crooks stole chats from 8 million accounts</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Koi researchers revealed that Urban VPN is operated by Urban Cyber Security Inc., which is affiliated with BiScience (B.I Science Ltd), a data broker company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“This company has been on researchers’ radar before,” the researchers added. “Security researchers Wladimir Palant and John Tuckner at <a href=\"https://secureannex.com/blog/sclpfybn-moneitization-scheme/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Secure Annex</a> have previously documented BiScience’s data collection practices.” Their research found that BiScience <a href=\"https://palant.info/2025/01/13/biscience-collecting-browsing-history-under-false-pretenses/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">collects</a> re-identifiable clickstream data at scale and monetizes it via its SDK and products like AdClarity and Clickstream OS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hundreds of millions of AI conversations have been captured, pooled across multiple extensions from the same publisher, reaching a combined user base well over eight million.<br /><br />Koi noted that the AI conversation capability on Urban VPN was introduced through extension updates over time, evolving from earlier browsing telemetry into broader monitoring of generative AI interactions as these tools gained mainstream adoption. The findings echo broader <a href=\"https://www.csoonline.com/article/4102571/keep-ai-browsers-out-of-your-enterprise-warns-gartner-2.html\">warnings</a> that browser-based AI tools and extensions are becoming an unmanaged <a href=\"https://www.csoonline.com/article/4099446/newly-discovered-malicious-extensions-could-be-lurking-in-enterprise-browsers.html\">risk layer</a> for enterprises, and should be treated as part of the attack surface rather than mere convenience features.</p>\n</div></div></div></div>",

        "title": "Incident response: How to implement a communication plan",
        "summary": "&lt;p&gt;An incident response communication plan is a crucial component of an organization's broader incident response strategy. As with other &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/feature/5-critical-steps-to-creating-an-effective-incident-response-plan\"&gt;elements of incident response planning&lt;/a&gt;, organizations should develop their crisis communications plans during a calm period to enable sound decision-making. Attempting to make good choices while in the high-pressure environment surrounding a security incident is a recipe for disaster.&lt;/p&gt; \n&lt;p&gt;Let's examine the steps CISOs and their teams can take to ensure their organization's cybersecurity incident communication plan is as effective as possible.&lt;/p&gt; \n&lt;section class=\"section main-article-chapter\" data-menu-title=\"Involve senior management and other stakeholders\"&gt;\n &lt;h2 class=\"section-title\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Involve senior management and other stakeholders&lt;/h2&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;When preparing a communications plan tailored to a cyberattack or other cybersecurity incident, give senior management and other departments, such as legal, HR, marketing and PR, the opportunity to contribute to it. Once written, obtain final approval from senior management for the program.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;  \n&lt;section class=\"section main-article-chapter\" data-menu-title=\"Build the plan in accordance with standards and regulations\"&gt;\n &lt;h2 class=\"section-title\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Build the plan in accordance with standards and regulations&lt;/h2&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Review relevant standards, regulations and frameworks that address cybersecurity, incident response and communications. This ensures the plan aligns with established standards and best practices and that it addresses the appropriate issues.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;For example, organizations subject to certain regulations, such as the GDPR, CCPA and the EU Network and Information Security Directive 2, must ensure their incident response plans are consistent with the requirements of these regulations.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Evaluate guidance from industry groups and government entities, such as \"NIST Special Publication 800-61 Revision 3: Incident Response Recommendations and Considerations for Cybersecurity Risk Management,\" \"ISO/IEC 27035-1:2023 Information technology -- Information security incident management\" and CISA's National Cyber Incident Response Plan (2024).&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Additional &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/tip/Incident-response-frameworks-for-enterprise-security-teams\"&gt;incident response frameworks&lt;/a&gt; to consider include the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, SANS Institute's Incident Response Framework and the Center for Internet Security's Control 19, Incident Response and Management.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;     \n&lt;section class=\"section main-article-chapter\" data-menu-title=\"Formalize the incident response team activation process\"&gt;\n &lt;h2 class=\"section-title\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Formalize the incident response team activation process&lt;/h2&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;The first step in the incident response communication process is the activation of the &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/incident-response-team\"&gt;incident response team&lt;/a&gt;. Any employee suspecting a security incident should contact their organization's security operations center (&lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/Security-Operations-Center-SOC\"&gt;SOC&lt;/a&gt;) or other designated 24/7 monitoring point. The SOC should then follow a standard triage process to determine if the event warrants the activation of the incident response team.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Note that some organizations establish a formal &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/feature/How-to-build-an-incident-response-team-for-your-organization\"&gt;computer security incident response team&lt;/a&gt; or computer incident response team, or put incident response under the purview of the SOC.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Once the has SOC determined that team activation is required, time is of the essence. Consider establishing a capability to generate alerts, using tools such as PagerDuty or FireHydrant. Emergency notification systems, such as those from AlertMedia and Envoy, can also be configured for incident response communications. These tools manage the process of scheduling calls and sending alert messages. Offloading these tasks to a dedicated platform reduces the burden on SOC analysts and enables the incident response team to convene faster. Many of these systems use AI elements to improve incident management.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;    \n&lt;section class=\"section main-article-chapter\" data-menu-title=\"Designate a point person for external and internal communication\"&gt;\n &lt;h2 class=\"section-title\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Designate a point person for external and internal communication&lt;/h2&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;As soon as word leaks of a security incident, internal personnel and external stakeholders -- including employees, customers, vendors and suppliers, the media, regulators and more -- will begin clamoring for information. It's therefore critical to coordinate all resources when communicating the response. This helps control rumors and ensures the organization presents a clear and consistent message across communication channels.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Create a communication role on the &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/feature/How-to-build-an-incident-response-team-for-your-organization\"&gt;incident response team&lt;/a&gt;. This person provides a consistent view of the incident to internal and external parties through regular updates.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;The person who holds the communication role does not need to possess deep technical knowledge, but they should have familiarity with concepts to serve as both a translator and filter for the technical information emerging from the response team. A glossary can help ensure the vocabulary used in written and verbal communications is correct and consistent.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;div class=\"youtube-iframe-container\"&gt;\n  &lt;iframe id=\"ytplayer-0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yo7l3hn1H6I?autoplay=0&amp;amp;modestbranding=1&amp;amp;rel=0&amp;amp;widget_referrer=null&amp;amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;amp;origin=https://www.techtarget.com\" type=\"text/html\" height=\"360\" width=\"640\" frameborder=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;     \n&lt;section class=\"section main-article-chapter\" data-menu-title=\"Create criteria for involvement of law enforcement\"&gt;\n &lt;h2 class=\"section-title\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Create criteria for involvement of law enforcement&lt;/h2&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Three of the most crucial decisions facing an incident response team dealing with a cybersecurity event are the following:&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;ol class=\"default-list\"&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;Whether it is appropriate to involve law enforcement.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;When notification of law enforcement should take place.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;Whether additional third parties should be notified and engaged.&lt;/li&gt; \n &lt;/ol&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;These are difficult decisions because law enforcement involvement often changes the nature of an investigation and increases the likelihood of public attention. On the other hand, law enforcement personnel have access to investigative tools, such as search warrants, that are unavailable to internal teams.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Certain incidents might require the assistance of third-party services experienced in cybersecurity and incident response. These organizations have tools to diagnose and remediate a cyberattack.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Incident response communication plans should address these quandaries by outlining clear criteria for when the team should notify law enforcement and request third-party services. The plan should identify who on the team has the authority to make that determination and what internal notifications should take place prior to involving law enforcement and others. For example, the team should consult with executive leadership and legal counsel prior to involving the authorities.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;      \n&lt;section class=\"section main-article-chapter\" data-menu-title=\"Develop communication templates for customer outreach\"&gt;\n &lt;h2 class=\"section-title\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Develop communication templates for customer outreach&lt;/h2&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Many cybersecurity incidents require some level of communication with customers or the general public; incident response communication plans should account for this.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;This might involve a notification in the event of an unauthorized release of personally identifiable information, or it might be an explanation to customers of a service disruption. The frequency, quality and content of these communications have a significant effect on public perception. These factors could limit or magnify the reputational damage associated with a cybersecurity incident.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;That's why communication templates are so critical to an incident response communication plan, especially in the aftermath of a cybersecurity incident.

Crafting a thoughtful and careful notification message can be challenging, and many stakeholders will want to be involved, including account managers, executives, lawyers, and PR experts.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Develop preapproved incident response communication templates in advance so the incident response team simply needs to fill in the blanks and tweak template language, as necessary.

Customers are quick to publicly voice their displeasure with an organization. While companies should regularly monitor their social media mentions, this becomes crucially important during a &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/feature/10-types-of-security-incidents-and-how-to-handle-them\"&gt;cyberattack or similar crisis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Social media feeds can provide the incident response team with a quick read on customer sentiment and serve as a trigger for rapid intervention if rumors start to spiral out of control. In addition, social media reports could provide the team with important indicators of service performance, information disclosures and other facts that might shape their response priorities.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Rapid and effective communication is an essential component of a strong response to a significant cybersecurity incident, such as a data breach. Solid incident communication plans provide mechanisms for the following:&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;ul class=\"default-list\"&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;Rapidly notifying stakeholders.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;Coordinating internal communications and external communications.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;Monitoring customer sentiment.&lt;/li&gt; \n &lt;/ul&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;These tools improve the organization's ability to respond to a crisis and help minimize reputational damage.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;      \n&lt;section class=\"section main-article-chapter\" data-menu-title=\"Emphasize training and awareness\"&gt;\n &lt;h2 class=\"section-title\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Emphasize training and awareness&lt;/h2&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Train all employees on crisis communications activities and their respective roles and responsibilities in the event of a cyberattack. This includes everything from ensuring all employees are aware of when to report suspected incidents to the SOC, to ensuring the person in the communication role has an up-to-date list of who to speak with in the wake of an incident.

Security firm CrowdStrike, in its new State of Ransomware Survey, notes that ransomware readiness is lagging as cyber criminals “use AI across the attack chain to accelerate intrusion, encryption, and extortion.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The report, based on a global survey of 1,100 IT and cybersecurity decision-makers, shows that 76% of organizations are struggling to match the speed and sophistication of AI-assisted attacks. About half of the respondents cite <a href=\"https://www.csoonline.com/article/4075912/ai-enabled-ransomware-attacks-cisos-top-security-concern-with-good-reason.html\">AI-enabled attack chains as today’s greatest ransomware threat</a>, and 85% say traditional detection is becoming obsolete against AI-enhanced attacks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“When it comes to ransomware, most companies are still treating it like a distant threat until it hits. Then it’s chaos,” says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/trevorhorwitz/\">Trevor Horwitz</a>, CISO at security company TrustNet. “A good ransomware playbook isn’t just documentation. It’s muscle memory. You have to train like you fight.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some key elements to consider for an effective ransomware approach.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"planning-and-tabletops-preparedness-begins-with-practice\">Planning and tabletops: Preparedness begins with practice</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Any organization that doesn’t have a cohesive plan in place for how to handle ransomware threats is asking for trouble. Planning an overall strategy — encompassing tools, processes, and people — is vital for maintaining business continuity and minimizing financial losses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Without a plan in place, enterprises risk launching a disorganized and ineffective response to attacks, which can result in lost data, significant systems downtime, compliance issues, and damaged brand or reputation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A key component of the planning process is to <a href=\"https://www.csoonline.com/article/2144047/mastering-the-tabletop-exercise-3-cyberattack-scenarios-and-how-to-plan-a-robust-response.html\">conduct cybersecurity tabletop exercises</a> to simulate how teams would conduct themselves <a href=\"https://www.csoonline.com/article/4069236/corporate-executives-exposed-to-cyber-attacks-talk-about-the-pitfalls-of-response-measures.html\">during an actual ransomware attack</a>. This enables organizations to test and improve their <a href=\"https://www.csoonline.com/article/3829684/how-to-create-an-effective-incident-response-plan.html\">incident response plan</a> in a no-risk environment, with a focus on decision-making, communication, and establishing clear-cut roles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Tabletop exercises are where everything starts,” Horwitz says. “If your executive team hasn’t sat in a room and worked through a simulated ransomware attack, start there. You don’t want to be figuring out who has the authority to pay a ransom or issue a public statement in the middle of an actual breach. You want to know how fast legal, IT, and [communications] can work together. The pressure is intense, and the decisions come fast. So the playbook should guide those decisions, not just sit on a shelf.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.csoonline.com/article/4006349/operation-999-ransomware-tabletop-tests-cyber-execs-response.html\">These exercises</a> enable enterprises to “create and maintain a ransomware-specific incident response playbook that defines roles, containment processes, forensic collection procedures, and communications templates,” says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnotte/\">John Otte</a>, senior security consultant at technology consulting firm Resultant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Perform realistic tabletop exercises with legal, communications, IT, and executive stakeholders, at a minimum annually, to test decision-making,” Otte says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.csoonline.com/article/570871/tabletop-exercises-explained-definition-examples-and-objectives.html\">Tabletop exercises</a> need to simulate real business disruption scenarios, not just technical failures, says <a href=\"https://www.iansresearch.com/our-faculty/faculty/detail/george-gerchow\">George Gerchow</a>, CSO at security firm Bedrock Data and faculty member at IANS Research, a research and advisory firm. “Effective ransomware preparedness begins with practice, not panic,” he says. “The most valuable sessions include leaders from operations, legal, finance, HR, and communications, because these teams face the toughest decisions under pressure.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><br />Staffing, skills, and training</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many organizations continue to find that cybersecurity experts are in short supply, so staffing up teams is a challenge. That can be problematic for a ransomware strategy. Companies need to have a variety of skills in place, including expertise in incident detection and prevention, incident response, firewall configuration, and other areas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They also need to be equipped to <a href=\"https://www.csoonline.com/article/3604803/security-awareness-training-topics-best-practices-costs-free-options.html\">train all employees</a> in how to help prevent ransomware attacks. This includes teaching them how to recognize, deal with, and report threats such as phishing emails, suspicious links, and questionable attachments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“On the staffing side, you <a href=\"https://www.csoonline.com/article/3846318/6-hard-earned-tips-for-leading-through-a-cyberattack-from-csos-whove-been-there.html\">need people who know what they’re doing</a>,” Horwitz says. “Not just cybersecurity folks, but people across legal, PR, and leadership. And not just headcount. You need readiness. A named incident commander. Someone with forensic skills. Someone who understands business risk and knows when to escalate.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Organizations often invest in tools before investing in people, and that’s backwards, Gerchow says. “Resilience relies on cross-functional preparedness, where employees understand not just what to do but why it matters,” he says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enterprises need to hold role-appropriate security training for users, including business leaders, IT teams, finance, etc., on realistic threats such as social engineering and malicious attachments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Business leaders should encourage ongoing training that connects cybersecurity risk to business continuity and reputation, Gerchow says. “It’s about building a culture where everyone, from the help desk to the boardroom, understands their role in maintaining operational integrity,” he says. “Regular awareness programs, role-specific response drills, and executive briefings help translate technical risks into business terms.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"prevention-steps\">Prevention steps</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Enterprises can invest in a range of technology solutions for both protection against ransomware attacks and remediation following an incident. Ransomware prevention requires a layered approach that includes regular software updates and patching, effective data and systems backups, and other cybersecurity tools such as firewalls, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and antivirus software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.csoonline.com/article/3520881/patch-management-a-dull-it-pain-that-wont-go-away.html\">Patch management</a> and vulnerability remediation are vitally important elements of ransomware defense, because ransomware attackers oftentimes exploit security flaws — <a href=\"https://www.csoonline.com/article/4074945/network-security-devices-endanger-orgs-with-90s-era-flaws.html\">increasingly in security devices themselves</a>. By addressing both of these areas, companies can proactively defend against ransomware threats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Maintain a prioritized and trackable patching program that keeps exploitable exposure to a minimum,” Otte says. “Couple automated deployment of patches with human verification of high-risk systems, and regularly run scans to identify drift or skipped patches.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.csoonline.com/article/568045/what-is-edr-endpoint-detection-and-response.html\">Endpoint detection and response (EDR)</a>, antivirus (AV) software, email security and phishing defenses, and <a href=\"https://www.csoonline.com/article/4031659/windows-tips-for-reducing-the-ransomware-threat.html\">identity and access management/MFA</a> are also important pieces of any ransomware strategy, Otte says. “Use a modern EDR that contains behavior-based detection, rollback, and isolation capabilities rather than relying solely on signature AV,” he advises.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the main ways ransomware attackers carry out their missions is via email. “From an IT security standpoint, the No. 1 attack vector is an email system,” says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/russbernst/\">Russ Ernst</a>, CTO at Blancco, a provider of data erasure and mobile lifecycle diagnostics products. “Email security best practices must be implemented across the entire organization.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Email security can include advanced phishing filters to prevent common ransomware delivery mechanisms, Otte says. Sophisticated access management can help minimize threats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Implement MFA anywhere you can, particularly for privileged accounts and remote access, and implement least-privilege principles to restrict opportunities to move laterally by attackers,” Otte says. “Keep admin credentials secured within a centrally managed secrets store, regularly rotate them, and don’t have shared local admin accounts. Insist on MFA before any privilege elevation. Track anomalous credential usage and apply detection against brute-force or lateral movement that employs privileged credentials.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"recovery-and-remediation\">Recovery and remediation</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If a company experiences a ransomware attack, it needs to go into recovery and remediation mode as quickly as possible to minimize the damage. This includes recovering systems and data as well as repairing any damage affecting employees, customers, and the corporate brand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Create comprehensive recovery playbooks with system restore sequence prioritized and public communications strategies that target customers, regulators, and law enforcement,” Otte says. “Engage legal counsel, cyber insurance points of contact, and forensic responders in advance to make informed, timely, and notification requirement-appropriate determinations.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When a ransomware attack happens, “the remediation needs to be fast but precise,” Horwitz says. “You have to isolate systems immediately. Stop the spread. Kill off the malware’s communication paths. Bring in forensics to figure out how they got in. Because if you don’t understand the entry point, restoring from backup might just reintroduce the threat.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enterprises need to verify their backups before using them, Horwitz says. “I’ve seen companies restore clean-looking data only to discover the malware had been sitting dormant for weeks,” he says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They also need to ensure regular backup processes are in place, Ernst says. “It is important to regularly back up data and also to test these backups regularly,” he says. “Data that is regularly backed up in an offline environment will not be affected by a direct ransomware attack.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Access to this stored data should help minimize downtime, Ernst says. “Backups also help you rebuild infrastructure if you choose to pay the ransom and get encryption keys — only to find your data has been corrupted and made unusable. If the organization understands how long it takes to rebuild from a backup, then it can infer the estimated downtime from a ransomware attack,” he says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Organizations that might consider negotiating with ransomware gangs on ransom payments should also <a href=\"https://www.csoonline.com/article/3568817/the-ransomware-negotiation-playbook-adds-new-chapters.html\">keep on top of the latest advice and tactics</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The recovery process is not just technical, Horwitz says, but also reputational. “If customer trust is shaken, you have to rebuild that fast,” he says. “That means communicating clearly, owning what happened, and explaining what’s being done. Law enforcement has to be notified. Regulators too. And the <a href=\"https://www.csoonline.com/article/4002175/8-things-cisos-have-learnt-from-cyber-incidents.html\">lessons from that attack</a> need to go right back into the playbook. What worked? What didn’t? Where did the team freeze up? That feedback loop is what strengthens your program.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having an effective internal and external ransomware communications plan is vital. “A ransomware attack communications strategy should be part of an organization’s general company playbook related to security breaches,” Ernst says. “It should spell out who must be informed — employees, customers, investors, other stakeholders — as well as how and when, what any communications will say, and who will do the communicating.”</p>\n</div></div></div></div>",

        "summary": "&lt;p&gt;Of all the security techniques aimed at ensuring data security and combating data breaches, data loss prevention tools are far and away the most common. DLP tools continuously monitor and analyze data to identify security policy violations and, if appropriate, stop them from continuing. DLP tools run the gamut, from those focusing on a single part of an organization, such as email services or laptops, to ones specializing in data backup, archival and restoration.&lt;/p&gt; \n&lt;p&gt;Some DLP tools encompass the entire organization -- and these are the focus of this article. First, let's discuss some must-have features and capabilities. Then, take a close look at six enterprise DLP tools for the information needed when evaluating the best product for your company's needs.&lt;/p&gt; \n&lt;section class=\"section main-article-chapter\" data-menu-title=\"Must-have DLP tool features and capabilities\"&gt;\n &lt;h2 class=\"section-title\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Must-have DLP tool features and capabilities&lt;/h2&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Enterprise DLP tools contain a wide range of features and capabilities. The following are the most essential:&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;ul class=\"default-list\"&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;The ability to automatically discover, inventory and classify sensitive data and its metadata. Data is constantly being created and changed, so a DLP tool unable to keep pace with potential data leaks is always missing things.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;The ability to analyze data in the following circumstances:&amp;nbsp; \n   &lt;ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\" class=\"default-list\"&gt; \n    &lt;li&gt;In any state -- in use, at rest or in transit.&lt;/li&gt; \n    &lt;li&gt;In any location, including user endpoints, on-premises servers, networks and cloud services.&lt;/li&gt; \n    &lt;li&gt;In any application, such as email, web, messaging platforms, social media, file sharing and &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/generative-AI\"&gt;generative AI&lt;/a&gt; technologies.&lt;/li&gt; \n   &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;The ability to use several types of analyses to accurately find problems. All analysis should take into consideration the context of the communication because activity that's completely normal in one context could be highly suspicious in another. Examples of analysis include the following:&amp;nbsp; \n   &lt;ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\" class=\"default-list\"&gt; \n    &lt;li&gt;Looking for suspicious values -- e.g., \"confidential.\"&lt;/li&gt; \n    &lt;li&gt;Doing complex pattern-matching -- e.g., to find credit card numbers.&lt;/li&gt; \n    &lt;li&gt;Finding copies of known sensitive data.&lt;/li&gt; \n    &lt;li&gt;Performing statistical analysis of data activity.&lt;/li&gt; \n    &lt;li&gt;Studying user behavior.&lt;/li&gt; \n   &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;The ability to act in one of several ways when the DLP software discovers a potential policy violation. For example, in one situation, you might want the tool to log a possible violation and alert an administrator. In another, you might want the tool to stop a data transfer, initiate an incident report through your &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/security-information-and-event-management-SIEM\"&gt;SIEM&lt;/a&gt; system and immediately involve your incident response team in handling the attempted breach. Tools might also be able to proactively fix basic policy violations, such as encrypting sensitive stored data.&lt;/li&gt; \n &lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;   \n&lt;section class=\"section main-article-chapter\" data-menu-title=\"Leading enterprise DLP tools\"&gt;\n &lt;h2 class=\"section-title\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Leading enterprise DLP tools&lt;/h2&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;The following six tools are a sampling of what's offered.

        "summary": "&lt;p&gt;ZMap, an open source utility under the Apache 2.0 license, is a unique and powerful high-speed network scanner designed to probe the internet. The app focuses on performance rather than depth. As a result, it conducts simple scans that are typically based on a single &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/port-number\"&gt;network port&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; \n&lt;p&gt;Let's examine how to use ZMap, installation options and general functionality, as well as compare ZMap to alternative scanners.&lt;/p&gt; \n&lt;section class=\"section main-article-chapter\" data-menu-title=\"ZMap use cases\"&gt;\n &lt;h2 class=\"section-title\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;ZMap use cases&lt;/h2&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;ZMap is primarily an information-gathering tool. Various research institutions rely on it to understand deployment patterns, service availability, port and protocol use, vulnerabilities, workflows and other data. These organizations use this information to explain internet utilization and technologies. They also use it to generate additional cybersecurity information.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Consider the following examples:&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;ul class=\"default-list\"&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;Academic and research-oriented internet scans.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;Vulnerability hunting and threat detection on the internet.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;Risk assessments for public-facing internet resources.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;Tracking technology adoption and service use on a per-port basis.&lt;/li&gt; \n &lt;/ul&gt;\n &lt;h3&gt;The ZMap Project&lt;/h3&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;ZMap is part of a larger collection of tools called the &lt;a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://zmap.io/\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;ZMap Project&lt;/a&gt;. The collection enables researchers to gain a deeper understanding of the internet's structure and functionality. ZMap was the first tool in the collection, but many others have followed, including:&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;ul class=\"default-list\"&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;ZGrab.&lt;/b&gt; An application-layer stateful scanner that offers greater depth and detail than ZMap but with lower performance.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;ZDNS.&lt;/b&gt; A DNS resolver application for rapidly completing lookups and gathering resource record information.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;ZTee.&lt;/b&gt; A tool to buffer and maintain scan data for performance.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;ZSchema.&lt;/b&gt; A high-level database programming language.&lt;/li&gt; \n &lt;/ul&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;The collection also includes several information-gathering tools for managing &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/X509-certificate\"&gt;X.509 certificates&lt;/a&gt;. Certificate services administrators and troubleshooters will benefit from these open source tools, among them ZCertificate, ZCrypto and ZLint. All of these utilities are supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;        \n&lt;section class=\"section main-article-chapter\" data-menu-title=\"How to install and build ZMap\"&gt;\n &lt;h2 class=\"section-title\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;How to install and build ZMap&lt;/h2&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Install the latest version of Zmap using the preferred package manager for your Linux or macOS. Your system might require you to use &lt;span style=\"font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;\"&gt;sudo&lt;/span&gt; to &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/tip/What-are-the-differences-between-su-and-sudo-commands\"&gt;elevate your privileges&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Linux users can run the following commands:&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;ul class=\"default-list\"&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;For Red Hat-derived distributions, use &lt;span style=\"font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;\"&gt;dnf install zmap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;For Debian-derived distributions, use &lt;span style=\"font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;\"&gt;apt install zmap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;For the Gentoo distribution, use &lt;span style=\"font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;\"&gt;emerge zmap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; \n &lt;/ul&gt;\n &lt;figure class=\"main-article-image full-col\" data-img-fullsize=\"https://www.techtarget.com/rms/onlineimages/zmap-dnf-info-f.jpg\"&gt;\n  &lt;img data-src=\"https://www.techtarget.com/rms/onlineimages/zmap-dnf-info-f_mobile.jpg\" class=\"lazy\" data-srcset=\"https://www.techtarget.com/rms/onlineimages/zmap-dnf-info-f_mobile.jpg 960w,https://www.techtarget.com/rms/onlineimages/zmap-dnf-info-f.jpg 1280w\" alt=\"Screenshot of the installed packages screen in ZMap\" data-credit=\"Damon Garn\" height=\"323\" width=\"560\"&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"main-article-image-enlarge\"&gt;\n   &lt;i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"w\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n &lt;/figure&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Many macOS users maintain software using the Homebrew package manager. It is a handy and powerful utility, especially when installing software not available on the Apple App Store. The &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchVirtualDesktop/tip/How-to-install-Homebrew-on-macOS-for-software-distribution\"&gt;Homebrew installation command&lt;/a&gt; for ZMap is &lt;span style=\"font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;\"&gt;brew install zmap&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;As with other open source software, you can also build the ZMap application from the original source code. ZMap relies on several dependencies, so plan to spend some time setting up your system for this process. You can find details on the &lt;a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/zmap/zmap/blob/main/INSTALL.md#building-from-source\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;ZMap build GitHub page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Run ZMap inside a Docker container if that best suits your use case.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;        \n&lt;section class=\"section main-article-chapter\" data-menu-title=\"How to scan with ZMap\"&gt;\n &lt;h2 class=\"section-title\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;How to scan with ZMap&lt;/h2&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Based on its design, ZMap scans as fast as your network interface allows. It generates Ethernet frames for its scans, so beware of the following performance issues:&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;ul class=\"default-list\"&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Overwhelming your network&lt;/b&gt;. Your network devices might not be able to handle ZMap's minimal Ethernet frames adequately, potentially leading to excessive traffic in your own switches, routers and other network devices.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Overwhelming the target network&lt;/b&gt;. Scanning a single network at full speed -- 1 Gbps or more -- could overwhelm the destination network devices, resulting in a DoS situation.&lt;/li&gt; \n &lt;/ul&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Other more complex TCP-based scanners permit throttling and other controls to avoid these problems. Be careful and respectful when using ZMap to manage these scans.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;h3&gt;How to conduct ZMap scans&lt;/h3&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Use the following ZMap scan to get started. Note that you might need to use &lt;span style=\"font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;\"&gt;sudo&lt;/span&gt; to run these scans.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;\"&gt;zmap -p 80 -r 128&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;The &lt;span style=\"font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;\"&gt;-p 80&lt;/span&gt; field indicates a port 80 scan (HTTP). The &lt;span style=\"font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;\"&gt;-r 128&lt;/span&gt; value sets a rate of 128 packets per second. You can also define a target subnet, as long as it isn't listed in the blocklist.txt file.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;figure class=\"main-article-image full-col\" data-img-fullsize=\"https://www.techtarget.com/rms/onlineimages/zmap-scan-f.jpg\"&gt;\n  &lt;img data-src=\"https://www.techtarget.com/rms/onlineimages/zmap-scan-f_mobile.jpg\" class=\"lazy\" data-srcset=\"https://www.techtarget.com/rms/onlineimages/zmap-scan-f_mobile.jpg 960w,https://www.techtarget.com/rms/onlineimages/zmap-scan-f.jpg 1280w\" alt=\"Screenshot of running a ZMap scan of port 80.\" data-credit=\"Damon Garn\" height=\"147\" width=\"558\"&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"main-article-image-enlarge\"&gt;\n   &lt;i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"w\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n &lt;/figure&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Add the &lt;span style=\"font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;\"&gt;-o zmapresults.csv&lt;/span&gt; parameter to write the results to a comma-separated values file for later analysis. ZMap only displays scan status information instead of results on the screen when using this option. Use the &lt;span style=\"font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;\"&gt;-O list&lt;/span&gt; option to display results in a human-readable format.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Try scanning various ports with ZMap. The following are a few options:&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;ul class=\"default-list\"&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;\"&gt;-M udp -p 53&lt;/span&gt; to check &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/tip/Why-does-DNS-use-TCP-Port-53-and-UDP-Port-53\"&gt;DNS&lt;/a&gt;-specific information.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;\"&gt;-p 80 -o scan.json -O json&lt;/span&gt; to format results for &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchDataCenter/tip/HCL-vs-JSON-Configuration-language-uses-pros-and-cons\"&gt;JSON&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;\"&gt;-r 1000&lt;/span&gt; implements rate limiting to prevent overwhelming the source or destination networks.&lt;/li&gt; \n &lt;/ul&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Use the &lt;span style=\"font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;\"&gt;--verbosity&lt;/span&gt; option to add more details to the results.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Various techniques can improve performance or modify the scan's accuracy to meet your needs. Refer to the &lt;a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/zmap/zmap/wiki/Getting-Started-Guide#performance\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;Getting Started Guide&lt;/a&gt; for additional options.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;h3&gt;ZMap configuration F=files&lt;/h3&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;ZMap uses two configuration files to manage its scans. Modifying these files enables you to block specific subnets or customize ZMap, eliminating the need to continually specify particular options.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;ul class=\"default-list\"&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;\"&gt;blocklist.conf&lt;/span&gt; -- this file contains various subnets defined as reserved, causing ZMap to ignore them, thus improving performance. You can specify additional subnets you want the tool to avoid scanning.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;\"&gt;zmap.conf&lt;/span&gt; -- instead of continually setting bandwidth parameters in your ZMap commands, you can configure default values using this file. The file resides at &lt;span style=\"font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;\"&gt;/etc/zmap/zmap.conf&lt;/span&gt; by default on Linux systems.&lt;/li&gt; \n &lt;/ul&gt;\n &lt;figure class=\"main-article-image full-col\" data-img-fullsize=\"https://www.techtarget.com/rms/onlineimages/zmap-blocklist-f.jpg\"&gt;\n  &lt;img data-src=\"https://www.techtarget.com/rms/onlineimages/zmap-blocklist-f_mobile.jpg\" class=\"lazy\" data-srcset=\"https://www.techtarget.com/rms/onlineimages/zmap-blocklist-f_mobile.jpg 960w,https://www.techtarget.com/rms/onlineimages/zmap-blocklist-f.jpg 1280w\" alt=\"Screenshot of a sample ZMap blocklist.conf file\" data-credit=\"Damon Garn\" height=\"101\" width=\"559\"&gt;\n  &lt;figcaption&gt;\n   &lt;i class=\"icon pictures\" data-icon=\"z\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Sample ZMap blocklist.conf file.\n  &lt;/figcaption&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"main-article-image-enlarge\"&gt;\n   &lt;i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"w\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n &lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;                  \n&lt;section class=\"section main-article-chapter\" data-menu-title=\"ZMap documentation and community\"&gt;\n &lt;h2 class=\"section-title\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;ZMap documentation and community&lt;/h2&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;The ZMap Project is generally well documented. The specific ZMap utility has several sources of information, including the following:&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;ul class=\"default-list\"&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/zmap/zmap/blob/main/INSTALL.md\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;Installation Guide&lt;/a&gt; offers instructions on using package managers to install ZMap or build it from source code.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/zmap/zmap/wiki/Getting-Started-Guide\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;Getting Started Guide&lt;/a&gt; is a comprehensive guide covering standard and advanced scanning options, warnings and troubleshooting steps.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/zmap/zmap/wiki/Scanning-Best-Practices\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;Scanning Best Practices&lt;/a&gt; includes basic guidelines for responsible and effective scanning.&lt;/li&gt; \n &lt;/ul&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Like many other Linux utilities, ZMap includes man pages for quick reference.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;figure class=\"main-article-image full-col\" data-img-fullsize=\"https://www.techtarget.com/rms/onlineimages/zmap-manzmap-f.jpg\"&gt;\n  &lt;img data-src=\"https://www.techtarget.com/rms/onlineimages/zmap-manzmap-f_mobile.jpg\" class=\"lazy\" data-srcset=\"https://www.techtarget.com/rms/onlineimages/zmap-manzmap-f_mobile.jpg 960w,https://www.techtarget.com/rms/onlineimages/zmap-manzmap-f.jpg 1280w\" alt=\"Screenshot of the ZMap man pages.\" data-credit=\"Damon Garn\" height=\"255\" width=\"560\"&gt;\n  &lt;figcaption&gt;\n   &lt;i class=\"icon pictures\" data-icon=\"z\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;ZMap's man pages.\n  &lt;/figcaption&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"main-article-image-enlarge\"&gt;\n   &lt;i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"w\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n &lt;/figure&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Consider asking questions -- or answering them -- in the &lt;a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/zmap/zmap/discussions\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;ZMap GitHub discussion boards&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;      \n&lt;section class=\"section main-article-chapter\" data-menu-title=\"ZMap vs. alternate scanners\"&gt;\n &lt;h2 class=\"section-title\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;ZMap vs. alternate scanners&lt;/h2&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Security managers can choose among a variety of &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchNetworking/tutorial/Use-Angry-IP-Scanner-to-audit-the-network\"&gt;network scanners&lt;/a&gt;, so what makes ZMap different?&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;h3&gt;ZMap vs. ZGrab&lt;/h3&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Begin by comparing it to another utility from the ZMap Project, ZGrab. ZGrab is an application-layer scanner that provides extensive capabilities and includes TCP handshakes for banner grabbing, certificate access and similar data.

Nmap tends to be the slowest of the three -- depending on the scan -- but provides more comprehensive results, including OS detection, scripting and service mapping.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Nmap is an essential cybersecurity tool, while ZMap and ZGrab are better for general research. That's not to say ZMap doesn't help users understand security concerns, but it's not designed with the stealth capabilities or flexibility of a tool like Nmap or &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/tutorial/How-to-capture-and-analyze-traffic-with-tcpdump\"&gt;tcpdump&lt;/a&gt;. Still, it's well worth the time to learn how to use ZMap, as well as its capabilities and best practices.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Editor's note:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;It is possible to use ZMap both lawfully and unlawfully. It is up to you to ensure your usage is lawful. Get appropriate permission and approval before performing port scans, and handle the information obtained ethically. If you are unsure whether your usage is lawful, do not proceed until you have confirmed that it is -- for example, by discussing and validating your planned usage with your organization's counsel.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Damon Garn owns Cogspinner Coaction and provides freelance IT writing and editing services.

The Raspberry Pi device “was paired with a cellular modem, enabling remote access to the ferry’s internal computer network and external connections.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The good news was that the attack attempt was halted because of good security procedures onboard, the story said. “Investigators said segregation between office and operational networks, along with the absence of remote access to critical controls, prevented lateral movement and ruled out sabotage or hijacking scenarios.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"enterprise-controls-watching-the-wrong-roads\">Enterprise controls ‘watching the wrong roads’</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The question for enterprise cybersecurity executives is how well their land-based buildings — offices, stores, gas stations, bank branches, manufacturing facilities, and so forth — would have held up under a similar physical attack. Analysts and other security experts were not optimistic about how they would have fared. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Most enterprise security programs are still built for the wrong kind of intruder. They are built for the person who breaks in, not the person who walks in. And the rogue device story is the clearest signal of that shift,” said <a href=\"https://greyhoundresearch.com/svg/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Sanchit Vir Gogia</a>, the chief analyst at Greyhound Research. “A Raspberry Pi class device with a cellular modem is not just a clever gadget, it is a way to create a new perimeter from inside your building.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He pointed out that an attacker “does not have to fight your firewalls if they can step around them. They do not need to beat your VPN if they can bring their own internet connection into your wiring closet. That is the part that should keep CISOs awake, because it means a lot of the controls we celebrate are watching the wrong roads. If the traffic leaves through cellular, it does not cross your monitored gateways. Your SOC can be doing everything right and will still see nothing.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.infotech.com/profiles/fred-chagnon\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Fred Chagnon</a>, principal research director at Info-Tech Research Group, agreed with Gogia’s concerns. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Most offices have dozens of live Ethernet ports in lobbies, under conference tables, and in hallways. These should be administratively disabled at the switch level by default. A port should only be activated when a specific, authorized MAC address is verified via 802.1X authentication,” Chagnon said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added, “modern threat actors use MAC Spoofing to make a Raspberry Pi look like a legitimate VoIP phone or printer. CISOs should invest in tools, like Sepio or advanced NACs, that perform physical layer fingerprinting. These tools analyze the electrical and timing characteristics of the hardware to detect if a ‘printer’ is actually a Linux-based implant.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chagnon also encouraged extensive use of port locks that require a key, and some type of tamper-evident tape over chassis and ports. “Security sweeps should include looking for extra wires, unauthorized USB hubs, or small boxes that don’t match the asset inventory,” he added. “If a door to a restricted area is opened and a new, unknown device simultaneously appears on that local switch, the SOC should receive a high-priority correlated alert.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Forrester Senior Analyst <a href=\"https://www.forrester.com/analyst-bio/paddy-harrington/BIO18204\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Paddy Harrington</a> said that many enterprise security executives “forget how susceptible these things are to attack” and specifically pointed to IoT and OT devices as prime targets. Too many security people, Harrington said, are looking at what shadow devices, such as fitness trackers, are supposed to do, and not focusing on the access the device could get as the start of a backdoor attack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“You shouldn’t be able to walk up to an Ethernet port and plug in anything. That device needs to be authenticated,” Harrington said, adding that he estimates that 50% of all enterprises cut too many corners on device security. “Why should any IoT lightbulbs have access to financial data?” he asked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When he confronts enterprise security leaders on physical security, he said, he gets pushback. For example, in a recent discussion about network segmentation, the executive told him, “To segment our environment to that degree is going to take a lot of time and effort, and we are redirecting our money elsewhere.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Harrington said, “I’m sorry, but that is a poor excuse.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, one security executive, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/fvillanustre/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Flavio Villanustre</a>, CISO for the LexisNexis Risk Solutions Group, said that these types of physical attacks can be challenging to block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The proliferation of inexpensive and very capable single board computers such as the Raspberry Pi have made this problem much harder. Intrusion detection in the network should have detected behavioral anomalies, but that’s easier said than done if you have a large complex network and the Raspberry Pi looks like just another normal IoT device,” Villanustre pointed out. “And this is assuming that it was even connected to the network, rather than [to] some ancient serial bus in the ship’s control systems.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"proceed-with-caution\">Proceed with caution</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Villanustre encouraged anyone discovering such a device to proceed cautiously. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Disconnecting the device could result in losing important forensic information if not careful. It’s not too hard to equip the device with a tiny battery or supercapacitor that would give it enough time to wipe itself out if disconnected from the network or somehow tampered with,” Villanustre said. “Trying to send false information is even harder, because you would need to identify the protocols used by the device to know what to send. A bigger concern is if the device is connected to perhaps another device in the ship and could trigger a damaging action if tampered with. It could even detonate explosives.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whisper Security CEO <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kakooch\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Kaveh Ranjibar</a> added that his advice for dealing with this kind of physical discovery is “immediate isolation and forensic analysis, but with one critical step before physical removal: map the blast radius. Before you pull the plug, capture the device’s network traffic. Who is it talking to? What domains is it querying?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Using infrastructure intelligence, you can often attribute the actor based on the neighborhood of the command-and-control servers they use, allowing you to understand if this is a script kiddie or a GRU operation before you touch the hardware,” Ranjibar said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p> Ranjibar said that when such devices phone home, they may reveal a lot of usable information. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“A rogue device like a Raspberry Pi, even with a cellular modem, isn’t invisible. It has to phone home to receive commands or exfiltrate data. It creates an infrastructure footprint: a new IP address, a DNS resolution or a connection to a specific Autonomous System Number (ASN),” Ranjibar said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“CISOs need to move beyond just monitoring their internal LAN,” he added. “They need continuous external infrastructure monitoring. If a device on your vessel or in your building starts communicating with a network block known for hosting state-sponsored malware, or if a new shadow asset appears on your perimeter, that is your tripwire. You might not catch the person planting the device, but you should instantly catch the device when it connects to the internet.”</p>\n</div></div></div></div>",

But Shipley said it is odd that Microsoft’s initial advice says that a workaround is available, but instead of detailing it, it <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/5666974/message-queuing-(msmq)-might-fail-with-the-decembe\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">urges admins to contact Microsoft Support For Businesses</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The scariest words when it comes to a serious bug in Windows you’re trying to fix, that’s crashing your applications, is, ‘Call us,’” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>MSMQ is a protocol for secure messaging between applications, Shipley noted, so if there is a problem, “it’s going to break stuff.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/status-windows-10-22h2#3751msgdesc\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft post</a> says that individuals using Windows Home or Pro editions on personal devices are “very unlikely to experience this issue. This issue primarily affects enterprise or managed IT environments,” including those running clustered MSMQ environments under load.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Symptoms include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>MSMQ becoming inactive;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Internet Information Services (IIS) sites failing with “Insufficient resources to perform operation” errors;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>applications unable to write to queues;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>errors such as “The message file ‘C:\\Windows\\System32\\msmq\\storage*.mq’ cannot be created” when creating message files;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>misleading log entries such as “There is insufficient disk space or memory”, despite sufficient disk space and memory being available.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Affected are servers running Windows Server 2019 and 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2 and Windows Server 2012.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also affected are PCs running Windows 10 version 22H2, Windows 10 version 21H2, Windows 10 version 1809, and Windows 10 version 1607. Support for Windows 10 ended October 14, so the issue should only affect these systems if admins have paid for extended support and received the December update.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This issue is caused by a December Patch Tuesday security update (KB5071546) that introduced changes to the MSMQ security model and NTFS permissions on the <em>C:\\Windows\\System32\\MSMQ\\ </em>storage folder. MSMQ users now require write access to this folder, which is normally restricted to administrators, says Microsoft. As a result, attempts to send messages via MSMQ APIs might fail with resource errors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“A workaround is available for affected devices,” says the Microsoft update. “To apply the workaround and mitigate this issue in your organization, please contact <a href=\"https://support.serviceshub.microsoft.com/supportforbusiness/onboarding\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft Support for business</a>. We are investigating this issue and will provide more information when it is available.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/bicer/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jack Bicer</a>, director of vulnerability research at Action1, suggested as a temporary workaround for MSMQ failures that Windows admins grant write access to the MSMQ directory <em>C:\\Windows\\System32\\msmq. </em>Once Microsoft provides the official update, revert the directory permissions to their original state and deploy the fix, he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Danny Nguyen of Wicloud suggested on a Microsoft Learn forum that admins could either roll back the December security update (KB5071546) or adjust the permissions, as Bicer suggests. However, Nguyen urged admins to consult with their security team before making system-level permission changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A Microsoft spokesperson was asked for comment, but no response was received by press time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn’t the first MSMQ problem in recent memory; <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2024-30080\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">last year Microsoft discovered a remote code execution vulnerability </a>(CVE-2024-30008) that carried a criticality rating of 9.8. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this case, however, said Robert Beggs, head of Canadian incident response firm DigitalDefence, although the cause of the issue is a security patch, the impact and workaround are not strictly security issues. Therefore, he believes the fix is a workaround that does not involve security and security support, but regular support for a Windows system. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for the company’s reason for asking admins to contact Microsoft Support for Business for the workaround, he suggested that Microsoft may want to spread the workload to ensure that security support is not overworked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More broadly, warned Shipley, any update that leads to a business application failure is the kind of issue that turns admins off patching. December is the biggest month of the year for retail, and not the time for POS machines to go down because of the installation of a new patch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This article originally appeared on <a href=\"https://www.computerworld.com/article/4108289/microsoft-warns-msmq-may-fail-after-update-breaking-apps.html\" target=\"_blank\">Computerworld</a>.</em></p>\n</div></div></div></div>",

This has since expanded to target European countries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ink Dragon might sound similar in its <em>modus operandi</em> to several other Chinese threat groups engaged in nation-state surveillance, such as UNC6384, whose campaigns targeted <a href=\"https://www.csoonline.com/article/4082701/chinese-hackers-target-western-diplomats-using-hard-to-patch-windows-shortcut-flaw.html\" target=\"_blank\">European diplomats</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, during a recent investigation at the office of a European government, <a href=\"https://blog.checkpoint.com/research/ink-dragon-expands-with-new-tools-and-a-growing-victim-network/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Check Point said</a> it had discovered that the group has now pivoted towards what it called “an unusually sophisticated playbook” with longer term goals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Key to this is IIS, Microsoft’s aging web server platform, which is still present in many networks, especially those in the public sector. This platform holds two attractions: it is widely deployed, and is often misconfigured and insecure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The campaign begins when attackers compromise an IIS server, gain access to the internal network where they harvest local credentials, study admin sessions, using these and Microsoft Remote Desktop to move laterally without attracting attention. At this point, the group installs a customized IIS module that turns the server into an invisible “quiet” relay inside the group’s wider global infrastructure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“These servers forward commands and data between different victims, creating a communication mesh that hides the true origin of the attack traffic,” explain Check Point’s researchers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"shadow-infrastructure\">Shadow infrastructure</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The attack has two goals: to compromise government servers and plunder their networks for intelligence while, secondly, borrowing them to relay attack traffic to and from other compromised servers in a way that makes detecting the group’s command &amp; control (C2) much harder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This tactic cleverly dodges the problem of having to rely on conventional C2 infrastructure which is vulnerable to takedown and disruption. Instead, the hijacked and trusted government servers become the infrastructure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Across incidents, the same story repeats. A small web facing issue becomes the first step. A series of quiet pivots leads to domain level control. The environment is then repurposed as part of a larger network that powers operations against additional targets,” said Check Point. As to the traffic itself, the group hides communication inside ordinary mailbox drafts, making it look like everyday communication.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coincidentally, Check Point found that a second Chinese threat group, RudePanda, was simultaneously exploiting IIS weaknesses to compromise government servers. This meant that RudePanda “ended up operating in the same [compromised] environments at the same time.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The discoveries underscore the issue of IIS misconfiguration. Beyond listing the <a href=\"https://research.checkpoint.com/2025/ink-dragons-relay-network-and-offensive-operation/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">group’s indicators of compromise (IoCs)</a>, Check Points offers no specific advice on how to counter this. Nevertheless, some actions suggest themselves: audit the modules running on IIS against a known good baseline, enable advanced IIS logging, configure IIS to make common view state vulnerabilities less likely, and consider putting IIS servers behind a web application firewall (WAF).</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n</div></div></div></div>",

        "summary": "<div>\n<h2><strong>Summary</strong></h2>\n</div>\n<p>This report is a collaborative research effort by the cyber security authorities of five nations: Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States.[1][2][3][4][5]</p>\n<p>In it we highlight the use of five publicly available tools, which have been used for malicious purposes in recent cyber incidents around the world. The five tools are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Remote Access Trojan: JBiFrost</li>\n<li>Webshell: China Chopper</li>\n<li>Credential Stealer: Mimikatz</li>\n<li>Lateral Movement Framework: PowerShell Empire</li>\n<li>C2 Obfuscation and Exfiltration: HUC Packet Transmitter</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To aid the work of network defenders and systems administrators, we also provide advice on limiting the effectiveness of these tools and detecting their use on a network.</p>\n<p>The individual tools we cover in this report are limited examples of the types of tools used by threat actors. You should not consider this an exhaustive list when planning your network defense.</p>\n<p>Tools and techniques for exploiting networks and the data they hold are by no means the preserve of nation states or criminals on the dark web. Today, malicious tools with a variety of functions are widely and freely available for use by everyone from skilled penetration testers, hostile state actors and organized criminals, to amateur cyber criminals.</p>\n<p>The tools in this Activity Alert have been used to compromise information across a wide range of critical sectors, including health, finance, government, and defense. Their widespread availability presents a challenge for network defense and threat-actor attribution.</p>\n<p>Experience from all our countries makes it clear that, while cyber threat actors continue to develop their capabilities, they still make use of established tools and techniques. Even the most sophisticated threat actor groups use common, publicly available tools to achieve their objectives.</p>\n<p>Whatever these objectives may be, initial compromises of victim systems are often established through exploitation of common security weaknesses. Abuse of unpatched software vulnerabilities or poorly configured systems are common ways for a threat actor to gain access. The tools detailed in this Activity Alert come into play once a compromise has been achieved, enabling attackers to further their objectives within the victim’s systems.</p>\n<h3>How to Use This Report</h3>\n<p>The tools detailed in this Activity Alert fall into five categories: Remote Access Trojans (RATs), webshells, credential stealers, lateral movement frameworks, and command and control (C2) obfuscators.</p>\n<p>This Activity Alert provides an overview of the threat posed by each tool, along with insight into where and when it has been deployed by threat actors. Measures to aid detection and limit the effectiveness of each tool are also described.</p>\n<p>The Activity Alert concludes with general advice for improving network defense practices.</p>\n<div>\n<h2><strong>Technical Details</strong></h2>\n</div>\n<h3>Remote Access Trojan: JBiFrost</h3>\n<p>First observed in May 2015, the JBiFrost RAT is a variant of the Adwind RAT, with roots stretching back to the Frutas RAT from 2012.</p>\n<p>A RAT is a program that, once installed on a victim’s machine, allows remote administrative control. In a malicious context, it can—among many other functions—be used to install backdoors and key loggers, take screen shots, and exfiltrate data.</p>\n<p>Malicious RATs can be difficult to detect because they are normally designed not to appear in lists of running programs and can mimic the behavior of legitimate applications.</p>\n<p>To prevent forensic analysis, RATs have been known to disable security measures (e.g., Task Manager) and network analysis tools (e.g., Wireshark) on the victim’s system.</p>\n<h4><strong>In Use</strong></h4>\n<p>JBiFrost RAT&nbsp;is typically employed by cyber criminals and low-skilled threat actors, but its capabilities could easily be adapted for use by state-sponsored threat actors.</p>\n<p>Other RATs are widely used by Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) actor groups, such as Adwind RAT, against the aerospace and defense sector; or Quasar RAT, by APT10, against a broad range of sectors.</p>\n<p>Threat actors have repeatedly compromised servers in our countries with the purpose of delivering malicious RATs to victims, either to gain remote access for further exploitation, or to steal valuable information such as banking credentials, intellectual property, or PII.</p>\n<h4><strong>Capabilities</strong></h4>\n<p>JBiFrost RAT is Java-based, cross-platform, and multifunctional. It poses a threat to several different operating systems, including Windows, Linux, MAC OS X, and Android.</p>\n<p>JBiFrost RAT allows threat actors to pivot and move laterally across a network or install additional malicious software. It is primarily delivered through emails as an attachment, usually an invoice notice, request for quotation, remittance notice, shipment notification, payment notice, or with a link to a file hosting service.</p>\n<p>Past infections have exfiltrated intellectual property, banking credentials, and personally identifiable information (PII). Machines infected with JBiFrost RAT can also be used in botnets to carry out distributed denial-of-service attacks.</p>\n<h4><strong>Examples</strong></h4>\n<p>Since early 2018, we have observed an increase in JBiFrost RAT being used in targeted attacks against critical national infrastructure owners and their supply chain operators. There has also been an increase in the RAT’s hosting on infrastructure located in our countries.</p>\n<p>In early 2017, Adwind RAT was deployed via spoofed emails designed to look as if they originated from Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, or SWIFT, network services.</p>\n<p>Many other publicly available RATs, including variations of Gh0st RAT, have also been observed in use against a range of victims worldwide.</p>\n<h4><strong>Detection and Protection</strong></h4>\n<p>Some possible indications of a JBiFrost RAT infection can include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Inability to restart the computer in safe mode,</li>\n<li>Inability to open the Windows Registry Editor or Task Manager,</li>\n<li>Significant increase in disk activity and/or network traffic,</li>\n<li>Connection attempts to known malicious Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, and</li>\n<li>Creation of new files and directories with obfuscated or random names.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Protection is best afforded by ensuring systems and installed applications are all fully patched and updated. The use of a modern antivirus program with automatic definition updates and regular system scans will also help ensure that most of the latest variants are stopped in their tracks. You should ensure that your organization is able to collect antivirus detections centrally across its estate and investigate RAT detections efficiently.</p>\n<p>Strict application allow listing is recommended to prevent infections from occurring.</p>\n<p>The initial infection mechanism for RATs, including JBiFrost RAT, can be via phishing emails. You can help prevent JBiFrost RAT infections by stopping these phishing emails from reaching your users, helping users to identify and report phishing emails, and implementing security controls so that the malicious email does not compromise your device. The United Kingdom National Cyber Security Centre (UK NCSC) has published <a href=\"https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/phishing\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Phishing attacks: defending your organisation\">phishing guidance</a>.</p>\n<h3>Webshell: China Chopper</h3>\n<p>China Chopper is a publicly available, well-documented webshell that has been in widespread use since 2012.</p>\n<p>Webshells are malicious scripts that are uploaded to a target host after an initial compromise and grant a threat actor remote administrative capability.</p>\n<p>Once this access is established, webshells can also be used to pivot to additional hosts within a network.</p>\n<h4><strong>In Use</strong></h4>\n<p>China Chopper is extensively used by threat actors to remotely access compromised web servers, where it provides file and directory management, along with access to a virtual terminal on the compromised device.</p>\n<p>As China Chopper is just 4 KB in size and has an easily modifiable payload, detection and mitigation are difficult for network defenders.</p>\n<h4><strong>Capabilities</strong></h4>\n<p>China Chopper has two main components: the China Chopper client-side, which is run by the attacker, and the China Chopper server, which is installed on the victim web server but is also attacker-controlled.</p>\n<p>The webshell client can issue terminal commands and manage files on the victim server. Its MD5 hash is publicly available (originally posted on hxxp://www.maicaidao.com).</p>\n<p>The MD5 hash of the web client is shown in table 1 below.</p>\n<table class=\"tablesaw tablesaw-stack\">\n<caption>Table 1: China Chopper webshell client MD5 hash</caption>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th scope=\"col\"><strong>Webshell Client</strong></th>\n<th scope=\"col\"><strong>MD5 Hash</strong></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>caidao.exe</td>\n<td>5001ef50c7e869253a7c152a638eab8a</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The webshell server is uploaded in plain text and can easily be changed by the attacker. This makes it harder to define a specific hash that can identify adversary activity. In summer 2018, threat actors were observed targeting public-facing web servers that were vulnerable to CVE-2017-3066. The activity was related to a vulnerability in the web application development platform Adobe ColdFusion, which enabled remote code execution.</p>\n<p>China Chopper was intended as the second-stage payload, delivered once servers had been compromised, allowing the threat actor remote access to the victim host. After successful exploitation of a vulnerability on the victim machine, the text-based China Chopper is placed on the victim web server. Once uploaded, the webshell server can be accessed by the threat actor at any time using the client application. Once successfully connected, the threat actor proceeds to manipulate files and data on the web server.</p>\n<p>China Chopper’s capabilities include uploading and downloading files to and from the victim using the file-retrieval tool <code>wget</code> to download files from the internet to the target; and editing, deleting, copying, renaming, and even changing the timestamp, of existing files.</p>\n<h4><strong>Detection and protection</strong></h4>\n<p>The most powerful defense against a webshell is to avoid the web server being compromised in the first place. Ensure that all the software running on public-facing web servers is up-to-date with security patches applied. Audit custom applications for common web vulnerabilities. [<a href=\"https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"OWASP Top Ten\">6</a>]</p>\n<p>One attribute of China Chopper is that every action generates a hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) POST. This can be noisy and is easily spotted if investigated by a network defender.</p>\n<p>While the China Chopper webshell server upload is plain text, commands issued by the client are Base64 encoded, although this is easily decodable.</p>\n<p>The adoption of Transport Layer Security (TLS) by web servers has resulted in web server traffic becoming encrypted, making detection of China Chopper activity using network-based tools more challenging.</p>\n<p>The most effective way to detect and mitigate China Chopper is on the host itself—specifically on public-facing web servers. There are simple ways to search for the presence of the web-shell using the command line on both Linux and Windows based operating systems. [<a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/breaking-down-the-china-chopper-web-shell-part-ii/\" title=\"Breaking Down the China Chopper Web Shell - Part II\">7</a>]</p>\n<p>To detect webshells more broadly, network defenders should focus on spotting either suspicious process execution on web servers (e.g., Hypertext Preprocessor [PHP] binaries spawning processes) and out-of-pattern outbound network connections from web servers. Typically, web servers make predictable connections to an internal network. Changes in those patterns may indicate the presence of a web shell. You can manage network permissions to prevent web-server processes from writing to directories where PHP can be executed, or from modifying existing files.</p>\n<p>We also recommend that you use web access logs as a source of monitoring, such as through traffic analytics. Unexpected pages or changes in traffic patterns can be early indicators.</p>\n<h3>Credential Stealer: Mimikatz</h3>\n<p>Developed in 2007, Mimikatz is mainly used by attackers to collect the credentials of other users, who are logged into a targeted Windows machine. It does this by accessing the credentials in memory within a Windows process called Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS).</p>\n<p>These credentials, either in plain text, or in hashed form, can be reused to give access to other machines on a network.</p>\n<p>Although it was not originally intended as a hacking tool, in recent years Mimikatz has been used by multiple actors for malicious purposes. Its use in compromises around the world has prompted organizations globally to re-evaluate their network defenses.</p>\n<p>Mimikatz is typically used by threat actors once access has been gained to a host and the threat actor wishes to move throughout the internal network. Its use can significantly undermine poorly configured network security.</p>\n<h4><strong>In Use</strong></h4>\n<p>Mimikatz source code is publicly available, which means anyone can compile their own versions of the new tool and potentially develop new Mimikatz custom plug-ins and additional functionality.</p>\n<p>Our cyber authorities have observed widespread use of Mimikatz among threat actors, including organized crime and state-sponsored groups.</p>\n<p>Once a threat actor has gained local administrator privileges on a host, Mimikatz provides the ability to obtain the hashes and clear-text credentials of other users, enabling the threat actor to escalate privileges within a domain and perform many other post-exploitation and lateral movement tasks.</p>\n<p>For this reason, Mimikatz has been bundled into other penetration testing and exploitation suites, such as PowerShell Empire and Metasploit.</p>\n<h4><strong>Capabilities</strong></h4>\n<p>Mimikatz is best known for its ability to retrieve clear text credentials and hashes from memory, but its full suite of capabilities is extensive.</p>\n<p>The tool can obtain Local Area Network Manager and NT LAN Manager hashes, certificates, and long-term keys on Windows XP (2003) through Windows 8.1 (2012r2). In addition, it can perform pass-the-hash or pass-the-ticket tasks and build Kerberos “golden tickets.”</p>\n<p>Many features of Mimikatz can be automated with scripts, such as PowerShell, allowing a threat actor to rapidly exploit and traverse a compromised network. Furthermore, when operating in memory through the freely available “Invoke-Mimikatz” PowerShell script, Mimikatz activity is very difficult to isolate and identify.</p>\n<h4><strong>Examples</strong></h4>\n<p>Mimikatz has been used across multiple incidents by a broad range of threat actors for several years. In 2011, it was used by unknown threat actors to obtain administrator credentials from the Dutch certificate authority, DigiNotar. The rapid loss of trust in DigiNotar led to the company filing for bankruptcy within a month of this compromise.</p>\n<p>More recently, Mimikatz was used in conjunction with other malicious tools—in the NotPetya and BadRabbit ransomware attacks in 2017 to extract administrator credentials held on thousands of computers. These credentials were used to facilitate lateral movement and enabled the ransomware to propagate throughout networks, encrypting the hard drives of numerous systems where these credentials were valid.</p>\n<p>In addition, a Microsoft research team identified use of Mimikatz during a sophisticated cyberattack targeting several high-profile technology and financial organizations. In combination with several other tools and exploited vulnerabilities, Mimikatz was used to dump and likely reuse system hashes.</p>\n<h4><strong>Detection and Protection</strong></h4>\n<p>Updating Windows will help reduce the information available to a threat actor from the Mimikatz tool, as Microsoft seeks to improve the protection offered in each new Windows version.</p>\n<p>To prevent Mimikatz credential retrieval, network defenders should disable the storage of clear text passwords in LSASS memory. This is default behavior for Windows 8.1/Server 2012 R2 and later, but can be specified on older systems which have the relevant security patches installed.[<a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/microsoft-security-advisory-update-to-improve-credentials-protection-and-management-may-13-2014-93434251-04ac-b7f3-52aa-9f951c14b649\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Microsoft Security Advisory: Update to improve credentials protection and management: May 13, 2014\">8</a>] Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016 systems can be protected by using newer security features, such as Credential Guard.</p>\n<p>Credential Guard will be enabled by default if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The hardware meets Microsoft’s Windows Hardware Compatibility Program Specifications and Policies for Windows Server 2016 and Windows Server Semi-Annual Branch; and</li>\n<li>The server is not acting as a Domain Controller.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You should verify that your physical and virtualized servers meet Microsoft’s <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/credential-guard/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Credential Guard overview\">minimum requirements for each release of Windows 10 and Windows Server</a>.</p>\n<p>Password reuse across accounts, particularly administrator accounts, makes pass-the-hash attacks far simpler. You should set user policies within your organization that discourage password reuse, even across common level accounts on a network. The freely available Local Administrator Password Solution from Microsoft can allow easy management of local administrator passwords, preventing the need to set and store passwords manually.</p>\n<p>Network administrators should monitor and respond to unusual or unauthorized account creation or authentication to prevent Kerberos ticket exploitation, or network persistence and lateral movement. For Windows, tools such as Microsoft Advanced Threat Analytics and Azure Advanced Threat Protection can help with this.</p>\n<p>Network administrators should ensure that systems are patched and up-to-date. Numerous Mimikatz features are mitigated or significantly restricted by the latest system versions and updates. But no update is a perfect fix, as Mimikatz is continually evolving and new third-party modules are often developed.</p>\n<p>Most up-to-date antivirus tools will detect and isolate non-customized Mimikatz use and should therefore be used to detect these instances. But threat actors can sometimes circumvent antivirus systems by running Mimikatz in memory, or by slightly modifying the original code of the tool. Wherever Mimikatz is detected, you should perform a rigorous investigation, as it almost certainly indicates a threat actor is actively present in the network, rather than an automated process at work.</p>\n<p>Several of Mimikatz’s features rely on exploitation of administrator accounts. Therefore, you should ensure that administrator accounts are issued on an as-required basis only. Where administrative access is required, you should apply privileged access management principles.</p>\n<p>Since Mimikatz can only capture the accounts of those users logged into a compromised machine, privileged users (e.g., domain administrators) should avoid logging into machines with their privileged credentials. Detailed information on securing Active Directory is available from Microsoft.[<a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/plan/security-best-practices/best-practices-for-securing-active-directory\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Best Practices for Securing Active Directory\">9</a>]</p>\n<p>Network defenders should audit the use of scripts, particularly PowerShell, and inspect logs to identify anomalies. This will aid in identifying Mimikatz or pass-the-hash abuse, as well as in providing some mitigation against attempts to bypass detection software.</p>\n<h3>Lateral Movement Framework: PowerShell Empire</h3>\n<p>PowerShell Empire is an example of a post-exploitation or lateral movement tool. It is designed to allow an attacker (or penetration tester) to move around a network after gaining initial access. Other examples of these tools include Cobalt Strike and Metasploit. PowerShell Empire can also be used to generate malicious documents and executables for social engineering access to networks.</p>\n<p>The PowerShell Empire framework was designed as a legitimate penetration testing tool in 2015. PowerShell Empire acts as a framework for continued exploitation once a threat actor has gained access to a system.</p>\n<p>The tool provides a threat actor with the ability to escalate privileges, harvest credentials, exfiltrate information, and move laterally across a network. These capabilities make it a powerful exploitation tool. Because it is built on a common legitimate application (PowerShell) and can operate almost entirely in memory, PowerShell Empire can be difficult to detect on a network using traditional antivirus tools.</p>\n<h4><strong>In Use</strong></h4>\n<p>PowerShell Empire has become increasingly popular among hostile state actors and organized criminals. In recent years we have seen it used in cyber incidents globally across a wide range of sectors.</p>\n<p>Initial exploitation methods vary between compromises, and threat actors can configure the PowerShell Empire uniquely for each scenario and target. This, in combination with the wide range of skill and intent within the PowerShell Empire user community, means that the ease of detection will vary. Nonetheless, having a greater understanding and awareness of this tool is a step forward in defending against its use by threat actors.</p>\n<h4><strong>Capabilities</strong></h4>\n<p>PowerShell Empire enables a threat actor to carry out a range of actions on a victim’s machine and implements the ability to run PowerShell scripts without needing powershell.exe to be present on the system Its communications are encrypted and its architecture is flexible.</p>\n<p>PowerShell Empire uses \"modules\" to perform more specific malicious actions. These modules provide the threat actor with a customizable range of options to pursue their goals on the victim’s systems. These goals include escalation of privileges, credential harvesting, host enumeration, keylogging, and the ability to move laterally across a network.</p>\n<p>PowerShell Empire’s ease of use, flexible configuration, and ability to evade detection make it a popular choice for threat actors of varying abilities.</p>\n<h4><strong>Examples</strong></h4>\n<p>During an incident in February 2018, a UK energy sector company was compromised by an unknown threat actor. This compromise was detected through PowerShell Empire beaconing activity using the tool’s default profile settings. Weak credentials on one of the victim’s administrator accounts are believed to have provided the threat actor with initial access to the network.</p>\n<p>In early 2018, an unknown threat actor used Winter Olympics-themed socially engineered emails and malicious attachments in a spear-phishing campaign targeting several South Korean organizations. This attack had an additional layer of sophistication, making use of <code>Invoke-PSImage</code>, a stenographic tool that will encode any PowerShell script into an image.</p>\n<p>In December 2017, APT19 targeted a multinational law firm with a phishing campaign. APT19 used obfuscated PowerShell macros embedded within Microsoft Word documents generated by PowerShell Empire.</p>\n<p>Our cybersecurity authorities are also aware of PowerShell Empire being used to target academia. In one reported instance, a threat actor attempted to use PowerShell Empire to gain persistence using a Windows Management Instrumentation event consumer. However, in this instance, the PowerShell Empire agent was unsuccessful in establishing network connections due to the HTTP connections being blocked by a local security appliance.</p>\n<h4><strong>Detection and Protection</strong></h4>\n<p>Identifying malicious PowerShell activity can be difficult due to the prevalence of legitimate PowerShell activity on hosts and the increased use of PowerShell in maintaining a corporate environment.</p>\n<p>To identify potentially malicious scripts, PowerShell activity should be comprehensively logged. This should include script block logging and PowerShell transcripts.</p>\n<p>Older versions of PowerShell should be removed from environments to ensure that they cannot be used to circumvent additional logging and controls added in more recent versions of PowerShell. This page provides a good summary of PowerShell security practices.[<a href=\"https://reliaquest.com/blog/powershell-security-best-practices/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"PowerShell Security Best Practices\">10</a>]</p>\n<p>The code integrity features in recent versions of Windows can be used to limit the functionality of PowerShell, preventing or hampering malicious PowerShell in the event of a successful intrusion.</p>\n<p>A combination of script code signing, application allow listing, and constrained language mode will prevent or limit the effect of malicious PowerShell in the event of a successful intrusion. These controls will also impact legitimate PowerShell scripts and it is strongly advised that they be thoroughly tested before deployment.</p>\n<p>When organizations profile their PowerShell usage, they often find it is only used legitimately by a small number of technical staff. Establishing the extent of this legitimate activity will make it easier to monitor and investigate suspicious or unexpected PowerShell usage elsewhere on the network.</p>\n<h3>C2 Obfuscation and Exfiltration: HUC Packet Transmitter&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>Attackers will often want to disguise their location when compromising a target. To do this, they may use generic privacy tools (e.g., Tor) or more specific tools to obfuscate their location.</p>\n<p>HUC Packet Transmitter (HTran) is a proxy tool used to intercept and redirect Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connections from the local host to a remote host. This makes it possible to obfuscate an attacker’s communications with victim networks. The tool has been freely available on the internet since at least 2009.</p>\n<p>HTran facilitates TCP connections between the victim and a hop point controlled by a threat actor. Malicious threat actors can use this technique to redirect their packets through multiple compromised hosts running HTran to gain greater access to hosts in a network.</p>\n<h4><strong>In Use</strong></h4>\n<p>The use of HTran has been regularly observed in compromises of both government and industry targets.</p>\n<p>A broad range of threat actors have been observed using HTran and other connection proxy tools to</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Evade intrusion and detection systems on a network,</li>\n<li>Blend in with common traffic or leverage domain trust relationships to bypass security controls,</li>\n<li>Obfuscate or hide C2 infrastructure or communications, and</li>\n<li>Create peer-to-peer or meshed C2 infrastructure to evade detection and provide resilient connections to infrastructure.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong>Capabilities</strong></h4>\n<p>HTran can run in several modes, each of which forwards traffic across a network by bridging two TCP sockets. They differ in terms of where the TCP sockets are initiated from, either locally or remotely. The three modes are</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Server (listen)</strong> – Both TCP sockets initiated remotely;</li>\n<li><strong>Client (slave) </strong>– Both TCP sockets initiated locally; and</li>\n<li><strong>Proxy (tran)</strong> – One TCP socket initiated remotely, the other initiated locally, upon receipt of traffic from the first connection.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>HTran can inject itself into running processes and install a rootkit to hide network connections from the host operating system. Using these features also creates Windows registry entries to ensure that HTran maintains persistent access to the victim network.</p>\n<h4><strong>Examples</strong></h4>\n<p>Recent investigations by our cybersecurity authorities have identified the use of HTran to maintain and obfuscate remote access to targeted environments.</p>\n<p>In one incident, the threat actor compromised externally-facing web servers running outdated and vulnerable web applications. This access enabled the upload of webshells, which were then used to deploy other tools, including HTran.</p>\n<p>HTran was installed into the ProgramData directory and other deployed tools were used to reconfigure the server to accept Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) communications.</p>\n<p>The threat actor issued a command to start HTran as a client, initiating a connection to a server located on the internet over port 80, which forwards RDP traffic from the local interface.</p>\n<p>In this case, HTTP was chosen to blend in with other traffic that was expected to be seen originating from a web server to the internet. Other well-known ports used included:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Port 53 – Domain Name System</li>\n<li>Port 443 - HTTP over TLS/Secure Sockets Layer</li>\n<li>Port 3306 - MySQL</li>\n<li>By using HTran in this way, the threat actor was able to use RDP for several months without being detected.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong>Detection and Protection</strong></h4>\n<p>Attackers need access to a machine to install and run HTran, so network defenders should apply security patches and use good access control to prevent attackers from installing malicious applications.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/introduction-logging-security-purposes\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Introduction to logging for security purposes\">Network monitoring</a> and firewalls can help prevent and detect unauthorized connections from tools such as HTran.</p>\n<p>In some of the samples analyzed, the rootkit component of HTran only hides connection details when the proxy mode is used. When client mode is used, defenders can view details about the TCP connections being made.</p>\n<p>HTran also includes a debugging condition that is useful for network defenders. In the event that a destination becomes unavailable, HTran generates an error message using the following format:</p>\n<div><code>sprint(buffer, “[SERVER]connection to %s:%d error\\r\\n”, host, port2);</code></div>\n<p>This error message is relayed to the connecting client in the clear. Network defenders can monitor for this error message to potentially detect HTran instances active in their environments.</p>\n<div>\n<h2><strong>Mitigations</strong></h2>\n</div>\n<p>There are several measures that will improve the overall cybersecurity of your organization and help protect it against the types of tools highlighted in this report.

        "title": "SamSam Ransomware",
        "summary": "<div>\n<h2><strong>Summary</strong></h2>\n</div>\n<p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) are issuing this activity alert to inform computer network defenders about SamSam ransomware, also known as MSIL/Samas.A. Specifically, this product shares analysis of vulnerabilities that cyber actors exploited to deploy this ransomware. In addition, this report provides recommendations for prevention and mitigation.</p>\n<p>The SamSam actors targeted multiple industries, including some within critical infrastructure. Victims were located predominately in the United States, but also internationally. Network-wide infections against organizations are far more likely to garner large ransom payments than infections of individual systems. Organizations that provide essential functions have a critical need to resume operations quickly and are more likely to pay larger ransoms.</p>\n<p>The actors exploit Windows servers to gain persistent access to a victim’s network and infect all reachable hosts. According to reporting from victims in early 2016, cyber actors used the JexBoss Exploit Kit to access vulnerable JBoss applications. Since mid-2016, FBI analysis of victims’ machines indicates that cyber actors use Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to gain persistent access to victims’ networks. Typically, actors either use brute force attacks or stolen login credentials. Detecting RDP intrusions can be challenging because the malware enters through an approved access point.</p>\n<p>After gaining access to a particular network, the SamSam actors escalate privileges for administrator rights, drop malware onto the server, and run an executable file, all without victims’ action or authorization. While many ransomware campaigns rely on a victim completing an action, such as opening an email or visiting a compromised website, RDP allows cyber actors to infect victims with minimal detection.</p>\n<p>Analysis of tools found on victims’ networks indicated that successful cyber actors purchased several of the stolen RDP credentials from known darknet marketplaces. FBI analysis of victims’ access logs revealed that the SamSam actors can infect a network within hours of purchasing the credentials. While remediating infected systems, several victims found suspicious activity on their networks unrelated to SamSam. This activity is a possible indicator that the victims’ credentials were stolen, sold on the darknet, and used for other illegal activity.</p>\n<p>SamSam actors leave ransom notes on encrypted computers. These instructions direct victims to establish contact through a Tor hidden service site. After paying the ransom in Bitcoin and establishing contact, victims usually receive links to download cryptographic keys and tools to decrypt their network.</p>\n<div>\n<h2><strong>Technical Details</strong></h2>\n</div>\n<p>NCCIC recommends organizations review the following SamSam Malware Analysis Reports. The reports represent four SamSam malware variants.

System owners and administrators should review any configuration changes before implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Audit your network for systems that use RDP for remote communication. Disable the service if unneeded or install available patches. Users may need to work with their technology venders to confirm that patches will not affect system processes.</li>\n<li>Verify that all cloud-based virtual machine instances with public IPs have no open RDP ports, especially port 3389, unless there is a valid business reason to keep open RDP ports. Place any system with an open RDP port behind a firewall and require users to use a virtual private network (VPN) to access that system.</li>\n<li>Enable strong passwords and account lockout policies to defend against brute force attacks.</li>\n<li>Where possible, apply two-factor authentication.</li>\n<li>Regularly apply system and software updates.</li>\n<li>Maintain a good back-up strategy.</li>\n<li>Enable logging and ensure that logging mechanisms capture RDP logins. Keep logs for a minimum of 90 days and review them regularly to detect intrusion attempts.</li>\n<li>When creating cloud-based virtual machines, adhere to the cloud provider’s best practices for remote access.</li>\n<li>Ensure that third parties that require RDP access follow internal policies on remote access.</li>\n<li>Minimize network exposure for all control system devices. Where possible, disable RDP on critical devices.</li>\n<li>Regulate and limit external-to-internal RDP connections. When external access to internal resources is required, use secure methods such as VPNs. Of course, VPNs are only as secure as the connected devices.</li>\n<li>Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications.</li>\n<li>Scan for and remove suspicious email attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its \"true file type\" (i.e., the extension matches the file header).</li>\n<li>Disable file and printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additional information on malware incident prevention and handling can be found in Special Publication 800-83, <em>Guide to Malware Incident Prevention and Handling for Desktops and Laptops</em>, from the National Institute of Standards and Technology.[<a href=\"https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-83r1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"NIST SP 800-83: Guide to Malware Incident Prevention and Handling for Desktops and Laptops\">1</a>]</p>\n<div>\n<h2><strong>Contact Information</strong></h2>\n</div>\n<p>To report an intrusion and request resources for incident response or technical assistance, contact NCCIC, FBI, or the FBI’s Cyber Division via the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>NCCIC\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"mailto:SayCISA@cisa.dhs.gov\" title=\"Report to CISA\">SayCISA@cisa.dhs.gov</a></li>\n<li>1-844-Say-CISA</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>FBI’s Cyber Division\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"mailto:CyWatch@fbi.gov\">CyWatch@fbi.gov</a></li>\n<li>855-292-3937</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>FBI through a <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices\" title=\"local field office\">local field office</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Feedback</strong></h2>\n<p>DHS strives to make this report a valuable tool for our partners and welcomes feedback on how this publication could be improved.

        "summary": "<div>\n<h2><strong>Summary</strong></h2>\n</div>\n<p>The National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC), part of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), is aware of a global Domain Name System (DNS) infrastructure hijacking campaign. Using compromised credentials, an attacker can modify the location to which an organization’s domain name resources resolve. This enables the attacker to redirect user traffic to attacker-controlled infrastructure and obtain valid encryption certificates for an organization’s domain names, enabling man-in-the-middle attacks.</p>\n<p>See the following links for downloadable copies of open-source&nbsp;indicators of compromise&nbsp;(IOCs) from the sources listed in the References section below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/AA19-024A_IOCs.csv\">IOCs (.csv)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/AA19-024A_IOCs.stix.xml\">IOCs (.stix)</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note: these files were last updated February 13, 2019, to remove the following three&nbsp;non-malicious IP addresses:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>107.161.23.204</li>\n<li>192.161.187.200</li>\n<li>209.141.38.71</li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n<h2><strong>Technical Details</strong></h2>\n</div>\n<p>Using the following techniques, attackers have redirected and intercepted web and mail traffic, and could do so for other networked services.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The attacker begins by compromising user credentials, or obtaining them through alternate means, of an account that can make changes to DNS records.</li>\n<li>Next, the attacker alters DNS records, like Address (A), Mail Exchanger (MX), or Name Server (NS) records, replacing the legitimate address of a service with an address the attacker controls. This enables them to direct user traffic to their own infrastructure for manipulation or inspection before passing it on to the legitimate service, should they choose. This creates a risk that persists beyond the period of traffic redirection.</li>\n<li>Because the attacker can set DNS record values, they can also obtain valid encryption certificates for an organization’s domain names. This allows the redirected traffic to be decrypted, exposing any user-submitted data. Since the certificate is valid for the domain, end users receive no error warnings.</li>\n</ol>\n<div>\n<h2><strong>Mitigations</strong></h2>\n</div>\n<p>NCCIC recommends the following best practices to help safeguard networks against this threat:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Update the passwords for all accounts that can change organizations’ DNS records.</li>\n<li>Implement multifactor authentication on domain registrar accounts, or on other systems used to modify DNS records.</li>\n<li>Audit public DNS records to verify they are resolving to the intended location.</li>\n<li>Search for encryption certificates related to domains and revoke any fraudulently requested certificates.</li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n<h2><strong>References</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://blog.talosintelligence.com/dnspionage-campaign-targets-middle-east/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"DNSpionage Campaign Targets Middle East\">Cisco Talos blog: DNSpionage Campaign Targets Middle East</a></li>\n<li>CERT-OPMD blog: [DNSPIONAGE] – Focus on internal actions</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/global-dns-hijacking-campaign-dns-record-manipulation-at-scale/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Global DNS Hijacking Campaign: DNS Record Manipulation at Scale\">Global DNS Hijacking Campaign: DNS Record Manipulation at Scale | Mandiant | Google Cloud Blog</a></li>\n<li>Crowdstrike blog: Widespread DNS Hijacking Activity Targets Multiple Sectors</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Revisions</strong></h2>\n</div>\n<p><strong>January 24, 2019:</strong> Initial version<br /><strong>February 6, 2019:</strong> Updated IOCs, added Crowdstrike blog<br /><strong>February 13, 2019:</strong> Updated IOCs</p>",

        "title": "New Exploits for Unsecure SAP Systems",
        "summary": "<div>\n<h2><strong>Summary</strong></h2>\n</div>\n<p>The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is issuing this activity alert in response to recently disclosed exploits that target unsecure configurations of SAP components. [<a href=\"https://github.com/msuiche/OPCDE/tree/master/2019/Emirates/(SAP)%20Gateway%20to%20Heaven%20-%20Dmitry%20Chastuhin%2C%20Mathieu%20Geli\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"(SAP) Gateway to Heaven - Dmitry Chastuhin, Mathieu Geli\">1</a>]</p>\n<div>\n<h2><strong>Technical Details</strong></h2>\n</div>\n<p>A presentation at the April 2019 Operation for Community Development and Empowerment (OPCDE) cybersecurity conference describes SAP systems with unsecure configurations exposed to the internet. Typically, SAP systems are not intended to be exposed to the internet as it is an untrusted network. Malicious cyber actors can attack and compromise these unsecure systems with publicly available exploit tools, termed “10KBLAZE.” The presentation details the new exploit tools and reports on systems exposed to the internet.</p>\n<h3>SAP Gateway ACL</h3>\n<p>The SAP Gateway allows non-SAP applications to communicate with SAP applications. If SAP Gateway access control lists (ACLs) are not configured properly (e.g., gw/acl_mode = 0), anonymous users can run operating system (OS) commands.[2] According to the OPCDE presentation, about 900 U.S. internet-facing systems were detected in this vulnerable condition.</p>\n<h3>SAP Router secinfo</h3>\n<p>The SAP router is a program that helps connect SAP systems with external networks. The default <code>secinfo</code> configuration for a SAP Gateway allows any internal host to run OS commands anonymously. If an attacker can access a misconfigured SAP router, the router can act as an internal host and proxy the attacker’s requests, which may result in remote code execution.</p>\n<p>According to the OPCDE presentation, 1,181 SAP routers were exposed to the internet. It is unclear if the exposed systems were confirmed to be vulnerable or were simply running the SAP router service.</p>\n<h3>SAP Message Server</h3>\n<p>SAP Message Servers act as brokers between Application Servers (AS). By default, Message Servers listen on a port 39XX and have no authentication. If an attacker can access a Message Server, they can redirect and/or execute legitimate man-in-the-middle (MITM) requests, thereby gaining credentials. Those credentials can be used to execute code or operations on AS servers (assuming the attacker can reach them). According to the OPCDE presentation, there are 693 Message Servers exposed to the internet in the United States. The Message Server ACL must be protected by the customer in all releases.</p>\n<h3>Signature</h3>\n<p>CISA worked with security researchers from Onapsis Inc.[<a href=\"https://www.onapsis.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Onapsis\">3</a>] to develop the following Snort signature that can be used to detect the exploits:</p>\n<p><code>alert tcp $EXTERNAL_NET any -&gt; $HOME_NET any (msg:\"10KBLAZE SAP Exploit execute attempt\"; flow:established,to_server; content:\"|06 cb 03|\"; offset:4; depth:3; content:\"SAPXPG_START_XPG\"; nocase; distance:0; fast_pattern; content:\"37D581E3889AF16DA00A000C290099D0001\"; nocase; distance:0; content:\"extprog\"; nocase; distance:0; sid:1; rev:1;)</code></p>\n<h2><strong>Mitigations</strong></h2>\n<p>CISA recommends administrators of SAP systems implement the following to mitigate the vulnerabilities included in the OPCDE presentation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ensure a secure configuration of their SAP landscape.</li>\n<li>Restrict access to SAP Message Server.\n<ul>\n<li>Review SAP Notes 1408081 and 821875.

        "summary": "<div>\n<h2><strong>Summary</strong></h2>\n</div>\n<p>The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is issuing this Activity Alert to provide information on a vulnerability, known as “BlueKeep,” that exists in the following Microsoft Windows Operating Systems (OSs), including both 32- and 64-bit versions, as well as all Service Pack versions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Windows 2000</li>\n<li>Windows Vista</li>\n<li>Windows XP</li>\n<li>Windows 7</li>\n<li>Windows Server 2003</li>\n<li>Windows Server 2003 R2</li>\n<li>Windows Server 2008</li>\n<li>Windows Server 2008 R2</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to take control of an affected system. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<div>\n<h2><strong>Technical Details</strong></h2>\n</div>\n<p>BlueKeep (CVE-2019-0708) exists within the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) used by the Microsoft Windows OSs listed above. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to perform remote code execution on an unprotected system.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>According to Microsoft, an attacker can send specially crafted packets to one of these operating systems that has RDP enabled.[<a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2019-0708\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Remote Desktop Services Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\">1</a>] After successfully sending the packets, the attacker would have the ability to perform a number of actions: adding accounts with full user rights; viewing, changing, or deleting data; or installing programs. This exploit, which requires no user interaction, must occur before authentication to be successful.</p>\n<p>BlueKeep is considered “wormable” because malware exploiting this vulnerability on a system could propagate to other vulnerable systems; thus, a BlueKeep exploit would be capable of rapidly spreading in a fashion similar to the WannaCry malware attacks of 2017.[2]</p>\n<p>CISA has coordinated with external stakeholders and determined that Windows 2000 is vulnerable to BlueKeep.</p>\n<div>\n<h3>Mitigations</h3>\n</div>\n<p>CISA encourages users and administrators review the Microsoft Security Advisory [<a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2019-0708\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Remote Desktop Services Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\">1</a>] and the Microsoft Customer Guidance for CVE-2019-0708 [<a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/customer-guidance-for-cve-2019-0708-remote-desktop-services-remote-code-execution-vulnerability-may-14-2019-0624e35b-5f5d-6da7-632c-27066a79262e\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Customer guidance for CVE-2019-0708 | Remote Desktop Services Remote Code Execution Vulnerability: May 14, 2019\">3</a>] and apply the appropriate mitigation measures as soon as possible:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Install available patches.</strong> Microsoft has released security updates to patch this vulnerability. Microsoft has also released patches for a number of OSs that are no longer officially supported, including Windows Vista, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003. As always, CISA encourages users and administrators to test patches before installation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For OSs that do not have patches or systems that cannot be patched, other mitigation steps can be used to help protect against BlueKeep:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Upgrade end-of-life (EOL) OSs.</strong> Consider upgrading any EOL OSs no longer supported by Microsoft to a newer, supported OS, such as Windows 10.</li>\n<li><strong>Disable unnecessary services.</strong> Disable services not being used by the OS. This best practice limits exposure to vulnerabilities. &nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>Enable Network Level Authentication.</strong> Enable Network Level Authentication in Windows 7, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2. Doing so forces a session request to be authenticated and effectively mitigates against BlueKeep, as exploit of the vulnerability requires an unauthenticated session.</li>\n<li><strong>Block Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) port 3389 at the enterprise perimeter firewall.</strong> Because port 3389 is used to initiate an RDP session, blocking it prevents an attacker from exploiting BlueKeep from outside the user’s network. However, this will block legitimate RDP sessions and may not prevent unauthenticated sessions from being initiated inside a network.</li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n<h2><strong>References</strong></h2>\n<p>[1] <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2019-0708\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Remote Desktop Services Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\">Microsoft Security Advisory for CVE-2019-0708</a><br />[2] White House Press Briefing on the Attribution of the WannaCry Malware Attack to North Korea<br />[3] <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/customer-guidance-for-cve-2019-0708-remote-desktop-services-remote-code-execution-vulnerability-may-14-2019-0624e35b-5f5d-6da7-632c-27066a79262e\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Customer guidance for CVE-2019-0708 | Remote Desktop Services Remote Code Execution Vulnerability: May 14, 2019\">Microsoft Customer Guidance for CVE-2019-0708</a></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<h2><strong>Revisions</strong></h2>\n</div>\n<p><strong>June 17, 2019:</strong> Initial version<br /><strong>June 17, 2019:</strong> Revised technical details section.</p>",

        "title": "Dridex Malware",
        "summary": "<div>\n<h2><strong>Summary</strong></h2>\n</div>\n<p>This Alert is the result of recent collaboration between the Department of the Treasury Financial Sector Cyber Information Group (CIG) and the Department of the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) to identify and share information with the financial services sector. Treasury and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) are providing this report to inform the sector about the Dridex malware and variants. The report provides an overview of the malware, related activity, and a list of previously unreported indicators of compromise derived from information reported to FinCEN by private sector financial institutions. Because actors using Dridex malware and its derivatives continue to target the financial services sector, including financial institutions and customers, the techniques, tactics, and procedures contained in this report warrant renewed attention. Treasury and CISA encourage network security specialists to incorporate these indicators into existing Dridex-related network defense capabilities and planning.

According to industry reporting, the original version of Dridex first appeared in 2012, and by 2015 had become one of the most prevalent financial Trojans. We expect actors using Dridex malware and its derivatives to continue targeting the financial services sector, including both financial institutions and customers.</p>\n<h3>Dridex-related Phishing Attributes</h3>\n<p>Actors typically distribute Dridex malware through phishing e-mail spam campaigns. Phishing messages employ a combination of legitimate business names and domains, professional terminology, and language implying urgency to persuade victims to activate open attachments. Sender e-mail addresses can simulate individuals (name@domain.com), administrative (admin@domain.com, support@domain.com), or common “do not reply” local parts (noreply@domain.com). Subject and attachment titles can include typical terms such as “invoice”, “order”, “scan”, “receipt”, “debit note”, “itinerary”, and others.</p>\n<p>The e-mail messages vary widely. The e-mail body may contain no text at all, except to include attachments with names that are strings of numbers, apparently relying on the subject line and victim curiosity to coerce the opening of the malicious file. Where there is a message body, the body may specifically state that the contents of the e-mail underwent virus scanning or simply directs the victim toward the link or attachment. In other cases, the body may include a long, substantive message, providing multiple points of contact and context for the malicious attachment. Attachment and hyperlink names vary from random sets of numbers or imitation automatic filenames from scanners to filenames purporting to reference financial records. Attachments may or may not have direct references using the same file name or strings of numbers in the bodies of the e-mails.</p>\n<p><strong>Example Links and Filenames </strong>(Note: link information is representative. Italicized statements are automatically generated by the cloud storage provider. # represents a random number.):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Link: HTTPS://WWW.GOOGLE[.]COM/URL?Q=HTTPS://WWW.(<em>Cloud Services Provider</em>)[.]COM/S/(<em>Cloud Account Value</em>) /RECENT%20WIRE%20PAYMENT %######.SCR?(<em>Cloud Provided Sequence</em>)</li>\n<li>Link: HTTPS://WWW.GOOGLE[.]COM/URL?Q=HTTPS://WWW.(<em>Cloud Services Provider</em>) [.]COM/S/ <em>Cloud Account Value</em>/AUTOMATEDCLEARINGHOUSE%20 PAYMENT####.DOC? (<em>Cloud Provided Sequence</em>)</li>\n<li>Link: Malicious File: ID201NLD0012192016.DOC</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Attachments or eventual downloads can take a variety of formats. In some instances, malware downloaders are concealed in compressed files using the ZIP or RAR file formats.&nbsp; Occasionally compressed files within compressed files (double zipped) are used. The compressed files can include extensible markup language (.xml), Microsoft Office (.doc, .xls), Visual Basic (.vbs), JavaScript (.jar), or portable document format (.pdf) files. Many of the files, rather than containing the actual malware, contain hidden or obfuscated macros. Upon activation, the macros reach to a command and control server, FTP server, or cloud storage site to download the actual Dridex malware. In other cases, macros launch scripts that extract executables imbedded in the document as opposed to downloading the payload.</p>\n<p>By default, software generally prevents execution of macros without user permission. Attached files, particularly .doc and .xls files, contain instructions on how a user should enable content and specifically macros, effectively using social engineering to facilitate the download. Malicious files sometimes even include screenshots of the necessary actions to enable macros.</p>\n<h3>Malware Capabilities</h3>\n<p>Dridex malware operates from multiple modules that may be downloaded together or following the initial download of a “loader” module. Modules include provisions for capturing screenshots, acting as a virtual machine, or incorporating the victim machine into a botnet. Through its history and development, Dridex has used several exploits and methods for execution, including modification of directory files, using system recovery to escalate privileges, and modification of firewall rules to facilitate peer-to-peer communication for extraction of data. Recent versions of Dridex exploit vulnerability CVE-2017-0199, which allows remote execution of code. This vulnerability is specific to Microsoft Office and WordPad. Microsoft released a patch in 2017.</p>\n<p>Once downloaded and active, Dridex has a wide range of capabilities, from downloading additional software to establishing a virtual network to deletion of files.&nbsp; The primary threat to financial activity is the Dridex’s ability to infiltrate browsers, detect access to online banking applications and websites, and inject malware or keylogging software, via API hooking, to steal customer login information. Dridex modules package, encrypt, and transmit captured information, screenshots, etc., via peer-to-peer (P2P) networks in the XML format or in binary format, as seen in newer versions. After stealing the login data, the attackers have the potential to facilitate fraudulent automated clearing house (ACH) and wire transfers, open fraudulent accounts, and potentially adapt victim accounts for other scams involving business e-mail compromise or money mule activity.</p>\n<p>The Dridex malware has evolved through several versions since its inception, partially to adapt to updated browsers. Although the characteristics described reflect some of the most recent configurations, actors continue to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in widely used software.</p>\n<h3>Dridex Malware and Variants</h3>\n<p>While Dridex is among the most prevalent sources of infection, previous variants and similar malware continue to represent a threat. Dridex is itself an improved variant of the Cridex and Bugat Trojans that preceded it, and it shares some of their codes. Although the previous variants’ theft activities operate in mostly the same way, the P2P communication aspects of Dridex improve its concealment and redundancy.</p>\n<h3>Ransomware</h3>\n<p>Actors distributing Dridex likely employ ransomware with similar configurations. Code for BitPaymer, also known as Friedex, includes numerous similarities to Dridex, despite its function as ransomware rather than data extraction. The two malwares use the same mechanics for several functions, and the authors compiled the codes at nearly the same time. The ransomware distributed through these malwares has targeted U.S. financial institutions and resulted in data and financial loss.</p>\n<p>Locky ransomware operates using the same delivery method for the downloader, with similar subject lines and attachments. Attackers also use the same botnets to deliver both Dridex and Locky ransomware, sometimes simultaneously. Variants of Locky include Zepto and Osiris. Locky ransomware and its variants have a wide footprint, with varying impact depending on victim IT policies and practices and network configurations.</p>\n<h3>Dridex-related Activity</h3>\n<p>Although the highest infection rates took place in late 2015 and early 2016, concurrent with Locky ransomware distribution, Dridex continues to impact numerous countries. The Dridex hackers appear to direct the majority of attacks at English-speaking countries. Cybersecurity industry reporting attributes Dridex, BitPaymer, and Locky campaigns, as well as other massive malware spam (malspam) campaigns to actors known alternately as Evil Corp or TA505. (Note: some cybersecurity industry reporting simply refers to the actors as “Dridex” or the “Dridex hackers.”) Actors distribute the malware via massive spam campaigns, sending up to millions of messages per day, although volume of messages varies widely.</p>\n<h2><strong>Indicators of Compromise</strong></h2>\n<p>The following indicators are associated with the activity described in this report:</p>\n<table class=\"tablesaw tablesaw-stack\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th scope=\"col\"><strong>Indicator Type</strong></th>\n<th scope=\"col\"><strong>Indicator Value</strong></th>\n<th scope=\"col\"><strong>Associated Activity</strong></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Email address</td>\n<td>info[@]antonioscognamiglio[.]it</td>\n<td>Dridex</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Email address</td>\n<td>info[@]golfprogroup[.]com</td>\n<td>Dridex</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Email address</td>\n<td>cariola72[@]teletu[.]it</td>\n<td>Dridex</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Email address</td>\n<td>faturamento[@]sudestecaminhoes[.]com.br</td>\n<td>Dridex</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Email address</td>\n<td>info[@]melvale[.]co.uk</td>\n<td>Dridex</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Email address</td>\n<td>fabianurquiza[@]correo.dalvear[.]com.ar</td>\n<td>Dridex</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Email address</td>\n<td>web1587p16[@]mail.flw-buero[.]at</td>\n<td>Dridex</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Email address</td>\n<td>bounce[@]bestvaluestore[.]org</td>\n<td>Dridex</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Email address</td>\n<td>farid[@]abc-telecom[.]az</td>\n<td>Dridex</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Email address</td>\n<td>bounce[@]bestvaluestore[.]org</td>\n<td>Dridex</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Email address</td>\n<td>admin[@]sevpazarlama[.]com</td>\n<td>Dridex</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Email address</td>\n<td>faturamento[@]sudestecaminhoes[.]com.br</td>\n<td>Dridex</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Email address</td>\n<td>pranab[@]pdrassocs[.]com</td>\n<td>Dridex</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Email address</td>\n<td>tom[@]blackburnpowerltd[.]co.uk</td>\n<td>Dridex</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Email address</td>\n<td>yportocarrero[@]elevenca[.]com</td>\n<td>Dridex</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Email address</td>\n<td>s.palani[@]itifsl.co[.]in</td>\n<td>Dridex</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Email address</td>\n<td>faber[@]imaba[.]nl</td>\n<td>Dridex</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Email address</td>\n<td>admin[@]belpay[.]by</td>\n<td>Dridex</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>IP address</td>\n<td>62[.]149[.]158[.]252</td>\n<td>Dridex</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>IP address</td>\n<td>177[.]34[.]32[.]109</td>\n<td>Dridex</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>IP address</td>\n<td>2[.]138[.]111[.]86</td>\n<td>Dridex</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>IP address</td>\n<td>122[.]172[.]96[.]18</td>\n<td>Dridex</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>IP address</td>\n<td>69[.]93[.]243[.]5</td>\n<td>Dridex</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>IP address</td>\n<td>200[.]43[.]183[.]102</td>\n<td>Dridex</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>IP address</td>\n<td>79[.]124[.]76[.]30</td>\n<td>Dridex</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>IP address</td>\n<td>188[.]125[.]166[.]114</td>\n<td>Dridex</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>IP address</td>\n<td>37[.]59[.]52[.]64</td>\n<td>Dridex</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>IP address</td>\n<td>50[.]28[.]35[.]36</td>\n<td>Dridex</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>IP address</td>\n<td>154[.]70[.]39[.]158</td>\n<td>Dridex</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>IP address</td>\n<td>108[.]29[.]37[.]11</td>\n<td>Dridex</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>IP address</td>\n<td>65[.]112[.]218[.]2</td>\n<td>Dridex</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div>\n<h2><strong>Mitigations</strong></h2>\n</div>\n<p>Treasury and CISA encourage users and organizations to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Contact law enforcement immediately report regarding any identified activity related to Dridex malware or its derivatives.

If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication.</li>\n<li>Restrict users’ ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unless required.</li>\n<li>Enforce a strong password policy and require regular password changes.</li>\n<li>Exercise caution when opening email attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known.</li>\n<li>Enable a personal firewall on workstations, and configure it to deny unsolicited connection requests.</li>\n<li>Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers.</li>\n<li>Scan for and remove suspicious email attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its “true file type” (i.e., the extension matches the file header).</li>\n<li>Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content.</li>\n<li>Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs).</li>\n<li>Scan all software downloaded from the Internet before executing.</li>\n<li>Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats.</li>\n<li>Implement appropriate access control lists.</li>\n<li>Exercise cybersecurity procedures and continuity of operations plans to enhance and maintain ability to respond during and following a cyber incident.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has published additional information on malware incident prevention and handling in their Special Publication 800-83, <a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/publications/guide-malware-incident-prevention-and-handling-desktops-and-laptops\" title=\"Guide to Malware Incident Prevention and Handling for Desktops and Laptops\">Guide to Malware Incident Prevention and Handling for Desktops and Laptops</a>.</p>\n<h3>Why Best Practices Matter</h3>\n<p>The National Security Agency (NSA) recently published its <a href=\"https://www.nsa.gov/Portals/70/documents/what-we-do/cybersecurity/professional-resources/csi-nsas-top10-cybersecurity-mitigation-strategies.pdf?v=1\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"NSA’S Top Ten Cybersecurity Mitigation Strategies\"><em>Top Ten Cybersecurity Mitigation Strategies</em></a> (this is the current website for Top 10 mitigation strategies). Aligned with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, the Strategies offer a risk-based approach to mitigating exploitation techniques used by Advance Persistent Threat (APT) actors.</p>\n<p>The <em>Strategies </em>counter a broad range of exploitation techniques used by malicious cyber actors. NSA’s mitigations set priorities for enterprise organizations to minimize mission impact. The mitigations also build upon the NIST Cybersecurity Framework functions to manage cybersecurity risk and promote a defense-in-depth security posture. The mitigation strategies are ranked by effectiveness against known APT tactics. Additional strategies and best practices will be required to mitigate the occurrence of new tactics.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Update and Upgrade Software Immediately. </strong>Apply all available software updates, automate the process to the extent possible, and use an update service provided directly from the vendor. Automation is necessary because threat actors study patches and create exploits, often soon after a patch is released. These “N-day” exploits can be as damaging as a zero-day. Vendor updates must also be authentic; updates are typically signed and delivered over protected links to assure the integrity of the content. Without rapid and thorough patch application, threat actors can operate inside a defender’s patch cycle.</li>\n<li><strong>Defend Privileges and Accounts. </strong>Assign privileges based on risk exposure and as required to maintain operations. Use a Privileged Access Management (PAM) solution to automate credential management and fine-grained access control. Another way to manage privilege is through tiered administrative access in which each higher tier provides additional access, but is limited to fewer personnel. Create procedures to securely reset credentials (e.g., passwords, tokens, tickets). Privileged accounts and services must be controlled because threat actors continue to target administrator credentials to access high-value assets, and to move laterally through the network.</li>\n<li><strong>Enforce Signed Software Execution Policies.</strong> Use a modern operating system that enforces signed software execution policies for scripts, executables, device drivers, and system firmware. Maintain a list of trusted certificates to prevent and detect the use and injection of illegitimate executables. Execution policies, when used in conjunction with a secure boot capability, can assure system integrity. Application Allow listing should be used with signed software execution policies to provide greater control. Allowing unsigned software enables threat actors to gain a foothold and establish persistence through embedded malicious code.</li>\n<li><strong>Exercise a System Recovery Plan. </strong>Create, review, and exercise a system recovery plan to ensure the restoration of data as part of a comprehensive disaster recovery strategy. The plan must protect critical data, configurations, and logs to ensure continuity of operations due to unexpected events. For additional protection, backups should be encrypted, stored offsite, offline when possible, and support complete recovery and reconstitution of systems and devices. Perform periodic testing and evaluate the backup plan. Update the plan as necessary to accommodate the ever-changing network environment. A recovery plan is a necessary mitigation for natural disasters as well as malicious threats including ransomware.</li>\n<li><strong>Actively Manage Systems and Configurations. </strong>Take inventory of network devices and software. Remove unwanted, unneeded, or unexpected hardware and software from the network. Starting from a known baseline reduces the attack surface and establishes control of the operational environment. Thereafter, actively manage devices, applications, operating systems, and security configurations. Active enterprise management ensures that systems can adapt to dynamic threat environments while scaling and streamlining administrative operations.</li>\n<li><strong>Continuously Hunt for Network Intrusions.</strong> Take proactive steps to detect, contain, and remove any malicious presence within the network. Enterprise organizations should assume that a compromise has taken place and use dedicated teams to continuously seek out, contain, and remove threat actors within the network. Passive detection mechanisms, such as logs, Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) products, Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions, and other data analytic capabilities are invaluable tools to find malicious or anomalous behaviors. Active pursuits should also include hunt operations and penetration testing using well documented incident response procedures to address any discovered breaches in security. Establishing proactive steps will transition the organization beyond basic detection methods, enabling real-time threat detection and remediation using a continuous monitoring and mitigation strategy.</li>\n<li><strong>Leverage Modern Hardware Security Features. </strong>Use hardware security features like Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) Secure Boot, Trusted Platform Module (TPM), and hardware virtualization. Schedule older devices for a hardware refresh. Modern hardware features increase the integrity of the boot process, provide system attestation, and support features for high-risk application containment. Using a modern operating system on outdated hardware results in a reduced ability to protect the system, critical data, and user credentials from threat actors.</li>\n<li>Segregate Networks Using Application-Aware Defenses. Segregate critical networks and services. Deploy application-aware network defenses to block improperly formed traffic and restrict content, according to policy and legal authorizations. Traditional intrusion detection based on known-bad signatures is quickly decreasing in effectiveness due to encryption and obfuscation techniques. Threat actors hide malicious actions and remove data over common protocols, making the need for sophisticated, application-aware defensive mechanisms critical for modern network defenses.</li>\n<li><strong>Integrate Threat Reputation Services. </strong>Leverage multi-sourced threat reputation services for files, DNS, URLs, IPs, and email addresses. Reputation services assist in the detection and prevention of malicious events and allow for rapid global responses to threats, a reduction of exposure from known threats, and provide access to a much larger threat analysis and tipping capability than an organization can provide on its own. Emerging threats, whether targeted or global campaigns, occur faster than most organizations can handle, resulting in poor coverage of new threats. Multi-source reputation and information sharing services can provide a more timely and effective security posture against dynamic threat actors.</li>\n<li><strong>Transition to Multi-Factor Authentication. </strong>Prioritize protection for accounts with elevated privileges, remote access, and/or used on high value assets. Physical token-based authentication systems should be used to supplement knowledge-based factors such as passwords and PINs. Organizations should migrate away from single factor authentication, such as password-based systems, which are subject to poor user choices and susceptible to credential theft, forgery, and reuse across multiple systems.</li>\n</ol>\n<div>\n<h2><strong>Contact Information</strong></h2>\n</div>\n<h5><strong>Reporting Suspected Malicious Activity</strong></h5>\n<p>To report an intrusion and

        "summary": "<div>\n<h2><strong>Summary</strong></h2>\n</div>\n<p>The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is sharing the following information with the cybersecurity community as a primer for assisting in the protection of our Nation’s critical infrastructure in light of the current tensions between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the United States and Iran’s historic use of cyber offensive activities to retaliate against perceived harm. Foremost, CISA recommends organizations take the following actions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Adopt a state of heightened awareness. </strong>This includes minimizing coverage gaps in personnel availability, more consistently consuming relevant threat intelligence, and making sure emergency call trees are up to date.</li>\n<li><strong>Increase organizational vigilance.</strong> Ensure security personnel are monitoring key internal security capabilities and that they know how to identify anomalous behavior. Flag any known Iranian indicators of compromise and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) for immediate response.</li>\n<li><strong>Confirm reporting processes.</strong> Ensure personnel know how and when to report an incident. The well-being of an organization’s workforce and cyber infrastructure depends on awareness of threat activity. Consider reporting incidents to CISA to help serve as part of CISA’s early warning system (see Contact Information section below).</li>\n<li><strong>Exercise organizational incident response plans. </strong>Ensure personnel are familiar with the key steps they need to take during an incident. Do they have the accesses they need? Do they know the processes? Are your various data sources logging as expected? Ensure personnel are positioned to act in a calm and unified manner.</li>\n</ol>\n<div>\n<h2><strong>Technical Details</strong></h2>\n</div>\n<h3>Iranian Cyber Threat Profile</h3>\n<p>Iran has a history of leveraging asymmetric tactics to pursue national interests beyond its conventional capabilities. More recently,&nbsp;its use of offensive cyber operations is an extension of that doctrine. Iran has exercised its increasingly sophisticated capabilities to suppress both social and political perspectives deemed dangerous to Iran and to harm regional and international opponents.</p>\n<p>Iranian cyber threat actors have continuously improved their offensive cyber capabilities. They continue to engage in more “conventional” activities ranging from website defacement, distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, and theft of personally identifiable information (PII), but they have also demonstrated a willingness to push the boundaries of their activities, which include destructive wiper malware and, potentially, cyber-enabled kinetic attacks.</p>\n<p>The U.S. intelligence community and various private sector threat intelligence organizations have identified the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a driving force behind Iranian state-sponsored cyberattacks–either through contractors in the Iranian private sector or by the IRGC itself.</p>\n<h3>Iranian Cyber Activity</h3>\n<p>According to open-source information, offensive cyber operations targeting a variety of industries and organizations—including financial services, energy, government facilities, chemical, healthcare, critical manufacturing, communications, and the defense industrial base—have been attributed, or allegedly attributed, to the Iranian government. The same reporting has associated Iranian actors with a range of high-profile attacks, including the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Late 2011 to Mid-2013 – DDoS Targeting U.S. Financial Sector:</strong> In response to this activity, in March 2016, the U.S. Department of Justice indicted seven Iranian actors employed by companies performing work on behalf of the IRGC for conducting DDoS attacks primarily targeting the public-facing websites of U.S. banks. The attacks prevented customers from accessing their accounts and cost the banks millions of dollars in remediation.[<a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/seven-iranians-working-islamic-revolutionary-guard-corps-affiliated-entities-charged\" title=\"[1]\">1</a>]</li>\n<li><strong>August/September 2013 – Unauthorized Access to Dam in New York State:</strong> In response, in March 2016, the U.S. Department of Justice indicted one Iranian actor employed by a company performing work on behalf of the IRGC for illegally accessing the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems of the Bowman Dam in Rye, New York. The access allowed the actor to obtain information regarding the status and operation of the dam.[<a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/seven-iranians-working-islamic-revolutionary-guard-corps-affiliated-entities-charged\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"[1]\">1</a>]</li>\n<li><strong>February 2014 – Sands Las Vegas Corporation Hacked: </strong>Cyber threat actors hacked into the Sands Las Vegas Corporation in Las Vegas, Nevada, and stole customer data, including credit card data, Social Security Numbers, and driver’s license numbers. According to a Bloomberg article from December 2014, the attack also involved a destructive portion, in which the Sands Las Vegas Corporation’s computer systems were wiped. In September 2015, the U.S. Director of National Intelligence identified the Iranian government as the perpetrator of the attack in a Statement for the Record to the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.[<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-12-11/iranian-hackers-hit-sheldon-adelsons-sands-casino-in-las-vegas\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"[2]\">2</a>]</li>\n<li><strong>2013 to 2017 – Cyber Theft Campaign on Behalf of IRGC:</strong> In response, in March 2018, the U.S. Justice Department indicted nine Iranian actors associated with the Mabna Institute for conducting a massive cyber theft campaign containing dozens of individual incidents, including “many on behalf of the IRGC.” The thefts targeted academic and intellectual property data as well as email account credentials. According to the indictment, the campaign targeted “144 U.S. universities, 176 universities across 21 foreign countries, 47 domestic and foreign private sector companies, the U.S. Department of Labor, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the State of Hawaii, the State of Indiana, the United Nations, and the United Nations Children’s Fund.”[<a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/nine-iranians-charged-conducting-massive-cyber-theft-campaign-behalf-islamic-revolutionary\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"[3]\">3</a>]</li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n<h2><strong>Mitigations</strong></h2>\n</div>\n<h3>Recommended Actions</h3>\n<p>The following is a composite of actionable technical recommendations for IT professionals and providers to reduce their overall vulnerability. These recommendations are not exhaustive; rather they focus on the actions that will likely have the highest return on investment. In general, CISA recommends two courses of action in the face of potential threat from Iranian actors: 1) vulnerability mitigation and 2) incident preparation.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Disable all unnecessary ports and protocols. </strong>Review network security device logs and determine whether to shut off unnecessary ports and protocols. Monitor common ports and protocols for command and control activity.</li>\n<li><strong>Enhance monitoring of network and email traffic.</strong> Review network signatures and indicators for focused operations activities, monitor for new phishing themes and adjust email rules accordingly, and follow best practices of restricting attachments via email or other mechanisms. &nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>Patch externally facing equipment.</strong> Focus on patching critical and high vulnerabilities that allow for remote code execution or denial of service on externally facing equipment.</li>\n<li><strong>Log and limit usage of PowerShell. </strong>Limit the usage of PowerShell to only users and accounts that need it, enable code signing of PowerShell scripts, and enable logging of all PowerShell commands.</li>\n<li><strong>Ensure backups are up to date</strong> and stored in an easily retrievable location that is air-gapped from the organizational network.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Patterns of Publicly Known Iranian Advanced Persistent Threats</h3>\n<p>The following mitigations and detection recommendations regarding publicly known Iranian advanced persistent threat (APT) techniques&nbsp;are based on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"ATT&amp;CK Matrix for Enterprise\">MITRE ATT&amp;CK Framework</a>.</p>\n<table class=\"tablesaw tablesaw-stack\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th scope=\"col\"><strong>Iranian APT Technique</strong></th>\n<th scope=\"col\"><strong>Mitigation and Detection</strong></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1003/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Credential Dumping\">Credential Dumping</a></td>\n<td>\n<p>Mitigation</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Manage the access control list for \"Replicating Directory Changes\" and other permissions associated with domain controller replication.</li>\n<li>Consider disabling or restricting NTLM.</li>\n<li>Ensure that local administrator accounts have complex, unique passwords across all systems on the network.</li>\n<li>Limit credential overlap across accounts and systems by training users and administrators not to use the same password for multiple accounts.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Detection</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Windows: Monitor for unexpected processes interacting with Isass.exe.</li>\n<li>Linux: The AuditD monitoring tool can be used to watch for hostile processes opening a maps file in the proc file system, alerting on the pid, process name, and arguments for such programs.</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1027/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Obfuscated Files or Information\">Obfuscated Files or Information</a></td>\n<td>\n<p>Mitigation</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Consider utilizing the Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) on Windows 10 to analyze commands after being processed/interpreted.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Detection</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Windows: Monitor for unexpected processes interacting with Isass.exe.</li>\n<li>Linux: The AuditD monitoring tool can be used to watch for hostile processes opening a maps file in the proc file system, alerting on the pid, process name, and arguments for such programs.</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1002/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Data Compressed\">Data Compressed</a></td>\n<td>\n<p>Mitigation</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Network intrusion prevention or data loss prevention tools may be set to block specific file types from leaving the network over unencrypted channels.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Detection</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Process monitoring and monitoring for command-line arguments for known compression utilities.</li>\n<li>If the communications channel is unencrypted, compressed files can be detected in transit during exfiltration with a network intrusion detection or data loss prevention system analyzing file headers.</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1086/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"PowerShell\">PowerShell</a></td>\n<td>\n<p>Mitigation</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Set PowerShell execution policy to execute only signed scripts.</li>\n<li>Remove PowerShell from systems when not needed, but a review should be performed to assess the impact to an environment, since it could be in use for many legitimate purposes and administrative functions.</li>\n<li>Disable/restrict the WinRM Service to help prevent uses of PowerShell for remote execution.</li>\n<li>Restrict PowerShell execution policy to administrators.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Detection</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If PowerShell is not used in an environment, looking for PowerShell execution may detect malicious activity.</li>\n<li>Monitor for loading and/or execution of artifacts associated with PowerShell specific assemblies, such as System.

        "title": "Critical Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows Operating Systems",
        "summary": "<div>\n<h3>Summary</h3>\n</div>\n<p>New vulnerabilities are continually emerging, but the best defense against attackers exploiting patched vulnerabilities is simple: keep software up to date. Timely patching is one of the most efficient and cost-effective steps an organization can take to minimize its exposure to cybersecurity threats.</p>\n<p>On January 14, 2020, Microsoft released software fixes to address 49 vulnerabilities as part of their monthly Patch Tuesday announcement. Among the vulnerabilities patched were critical weaknesses in Windows CryptoAPI,&nbsp;Windows Remote Desktop Gateway (RD Gateway),&nbsp;and Windows Remote Desktop&nbsp;Client. An attacker could remotely exploit these vulnerabilities to decrypt, modify, or inject data on user connections:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>CryptoAPI spoofing vulnerability – CVE-2020-0601:</strong> This vulnerability affects all machines running 32- or 64-bit Windows 10 operating systems, including Windows Server versions 2016 and 2019. This vulnerability allows Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) certificate validation to bypass the trust store, enabling unwanted or malicious software to masquerade as authentically signed by a trusted or trustworthy organization. This could deceive users or thwart malware detection methods such as antivirus. Additionally, a maliciously crafted certificate could be issued for a hostname that did not authorize it, and a browser that relies on Windows CryptoAPI would not issue a warning, allowing an attacker to decrypt, modify, or inject data on user connections without detection.</li>\n<li><strong>Windows RD Gateway and Windows Remote Desktop Client vulnerabilities – CVE-2020-0609, CVE-2020-0610, and CVE-2020-0611: </strong>These vulnerabilities affect Windows Server 2012 and newer. In addition, CVE-2020-0611 affects Windows 7 and newer. These vulnerabilities—in the Windows Remote Desktop Client and RD Gateway Server—allow for remote code execution, where arbitrary code could be run freely. The server vulnerabilities do not require authentication or user interaction and can be exploited by a specially crafted request. The client vulnerability can be exploited by convincing a user to connect to a malicious server.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is unaware of active exploitation of these vulnerabilities. However, because patches have been publicly released, the underlying vulnerabilities can be reverse-engineered to create exploits that target unpatched systems.</p>\n<p>CISA strongly recommends organizations install these critical patches as soon as possible—prioritize patching by starting with mission critical systems, internet-facing systems, and networked servers. Organizations should then prioritize patching other affected information technology/operational technology (IT/OT) assets.</p>\n<div>\n<h3>Technical Details</h3>\n</div>\n<h3>CryptoAPI Spoofing Vulnerability – CVE-2020-0601</h3>\n<p>A spoofing vulnerability exists in the way Windows CryptoAPI (Crypt32.dll) validates ECC certificates.</p>\n<p>According to Microsoft, “an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by using a spoofed code-signing certificate to sign a malicious executable, making it appear the file was from a trusted, legitimate source. The user would have no way of knowing the file was malicious, because the digital signature would appear to be from a trusted provider.” Additionally, “a successful exploit could also allow the attacker to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks and decrypt confidential information on user connections to the affected software.”<a href=\"https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-0601\">[1]</a></p>\n<p>A cyber attacker could exploit CVE-2020-0601 to obtain sensitive information, such as financial information, or run malware on a targeted system; for example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>A maliciously crafted certificate could appear to be issued for a hostname that did not authorize it, </strong>preventing a browser that relies on Windows CryptoAPI from validating its authenticity and issuing warnings. If the certificate impersonates a user’s bank website, their financial information could be exposed.</li>\n<li><strong>Signed malware can bypass protections (e.g., antivirus) that only run applications with valid signatures.</strong> Malicious files, emails, and executables can appear legitimate to unpatched users.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Microsoft Security Advisory for <a href=\"https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-0601\">CVE-2020-0601</a> addresses this vulnerability by ensuring that Windows CryptoAPI completely validates ECC certificates.</p>\n<h4><strong>Detection Measures</strong></h4>\n<p>The National Security Agency (NSA) provides detection measures for CVE-2020-0601 in their <a href=\"https://media.defense.gov/2020/Jan/14/2002234275/-1/-1/0/CSA-WINDOWS-10-CRYPT-LIB-20190114.PDF\">Cybersecurity Advisory: Patch Critical Cryptographic Vulnerability in Microsoft Windows Clients and Servers</a>.<a href=\"https://media.defense.gov/2020/Jan/14/2002234275/-1/-1/0/CSA-WINDOWS-10-CRYPT-LIB-20190114.PDF\">[2]</a></p>\n<h3>Windows RD Gateway Vulnerabilities – CVE-2020-0609/CVE-2020-0610</h3>\n<p>According to Microsoft, “A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Windows Remote Desktop Gateway (RD Gateway) when an unauthenticated attacker connects to the target system using RDP and sends specially crafted requests. This vulnerability is pre-authentication and requires no user interaction.”<a href=\"https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-0609\">[3]</a>,<a href=\"https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-0610\">[4]</a></p>\n<p>CVE-2020-0609/CVE-2020-0610:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Affects all supported Windows Server versions (Server 2012 and newer; support for Server 2008 ends January 14, 2020);</li>\n<li>Occurs pre-authentication; and</li>\n<li>Requires no user interaction to perform.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Microsoft Security Advisories for <a href=\"https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-0609\">CVE-2020-0609</a> and <a href=\"https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-0610\">CVE-2020-0610</a> address these vulnerabilities.</p>\n<h3>Windows Remote Desktop Client Vulnerability – CVE-2020-0611</h3>\n<p>According to Microsoft, “A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Windows Remote Desktop Client when a user connects to a malicious server. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute arbitrary code on the computer of the connecting client.”<a href=\"https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-0611\">[5]</a></p>\n<p>CVE-2020-0611 requires the user to connect to a malicious server via social engineering, Domain Name Server (DNS) poisoning, a man-in the-middle attack, or by the attacker compromising a legitimate server.</p>\n<p>The Microsoft Security Advisory for <a href=\"https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-0611\">CVE-2020-0611</a> addresses this vulnerability.</p>\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\n<h2>Impact</h2>\n<p>A successful network intrusion can have severe impacts, particularly if the compromise becomes public and sensitive information is exposed. Possible impacts include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Temporary or permanent loss of sensitive or proprietary information,</li>\n<li>Disruption to regular operations,</li>\n<li>Financial losses relating to restoring systems and files, and</li>\n<li>Potential harm to an organization’s reputation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div>\n<h3>Mitigations</h3>\n</div>\n<p>CISA strongly recommends organizations read the <a href=\"https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-us/security-guidance\">Microsoft January 2020 Release Notes page</a> for more information and apply critical patches as soon as possible—prioritize patching by starting with mission critical systems, internet-facing systems, and networked servers.

        "summary": "&lt;p&gt;Organizations use third-party software and develop their own applications to make their business function. Such applications are often essential to operations, which means the security of those apps is also of great importance.&lt;/p&gt; \n&lt;p&gt;The principal goal of application security is to prevent attackers -- whether internal or external -- from accessing, modifying or deleting sensitive or proprietary data. It is also important to prevent attackers from altering or modifying applications, as this makes them more vulnerable to cyberattacks.&lt;/p&gt; \n&lt;p&gt;From initial application research and requirements definition activities to final deployment and launching of maintenance, security should be a major factor at each stage of the software development lifecycle (&lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchsoftwarequality/definition/software-development-life-cycle-SDLC\"&gt;SDLC&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt; \n&lt;p&gt;Follow these essential application security best practices to bolster your organization's &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/tip/How-to-build-an-application-security-program\"&gt;application security program&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; \n&lt;section class=\"section main-article-chapter\" data-menu-title=\"1. Understand the requirements\"&gt;\n &lt;h2 class=\"section-title\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;1. Understand the requirements&lt;/h2&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;When developing or adopting an application, define the app, what it will do, its scope of activities, who will access it and other criteria defined by the business units using it. This step includes identifying all resources -- e.g., system, networks and cloud services -- that will use the application, as well as its dependencies. &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/tip/How-to-create-an-SBOM-with-example-and-template\"&gt;Creating a software bill of materials&lt;/a&gt; is important in this step.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;  \n&lt;section class=\"section main-article-chapter\" data-menu-title=\"2.

Adding layers of protection improves security because attackers would need to compromise multiple defenses to reach the application.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;  \n&lt;section class=\"section main-article-chapter\" data-menu-title=\"5. Conduct risk, threat and vulnerability analyses\"&gt;\n &lt;h2 class=\"section-title\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;5. Conduct risk, threat and vulnerability analyses&lt;/h2&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;These activities identify issues and situations that could affect the application's security posture. Perform analysis prior to coding or before an off-the-shelf application enters production environments. Outputs include identifying potential security events and their worst-case outcomes, as well as single points of failure.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Schedule periodic risk analyses to ensure security measures continue to address applicable risks, threats and vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;   \n&lt;section class=\"section main-article-chapter\" data-menu-title=\"6. Identify and implement security controls\"&gt;\n &lt;h2 class=\"section-title\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;6. Identify and implement security controls&lt;/h2&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Factor the following controls into the app's development and ongoing management. Review them continuously during each stage of the SDLC, including regularly after deployment into production:&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;ul class=\"default-list\"&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Access controls.&lt;/b&gt; Prevent unauthorized access to the application and its data. &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/feature/How-to-implement-zero-trust-security-from-people-who-did-it\"&gt;Implement zero-trust&lt;/a&gt; network access, which assumes all access attempts are risky and should not be trusted until sufficient verification has been completed.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authentication controls.&lt;/b&gt; Verify that the individuals seeking access are who they claim to be. Implement &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/multifactor-authentication-MFA\"&gt;MFA&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authorization controls.&lt;/b&gt; Verify that the people requesting access to an app are approved for such access. Use &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/role-based-access-control-RBAC\"&gt;role-based access control&lt;/a&gt;, which links app access to a person's job and responsibilities, and the &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/principle-of-least-privilege-POLP\"&gt;principle of least privilege&lt;/a&gt;, which provides users access to only the resources they need to do their jobs -- and nothing else.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Corrective controls.&lt;/b&gt; Address and mitigate security problems. Actions could include shutting down an app that is suspected of permitting a breach or installing a security patch.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Detection controls.&lt;/b&gt; Once an app is in production, identify security events using technologies including firewalls, intrusion detection systems (&lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/intrusion-detection-system\"&gt;IDSes&lt;/a&gt;) and application scanning tools.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Encryption controls.&lt;/b&gt; Activate at the network and app levels. Encrypt data input and output, and data in motion and at rest to prevent unauthorized access.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Logging controls.&lt;/b&gt; Track activity by application. This helps identify suspicious traffic and behaviors, while also providing important metrics for measuring application performance.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Preventive controls.&lt;/b&gt; Build into the application so they are in place when the app goes live. These controls are designed to block unauthorized attempts to access the app and its data. Technologies include firewalls and intrusion prevention systems (IPSes).&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Security-testing controls.&lt;/b&gt; Identify weaknesses and vulnerabilities in the app. These essential capabilities are especially important during the development and testing stages.&lt;i&gt; Learn about the &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/tip/Key-types-of-application-security-testing\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;key types of application security testing&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt; \n &lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;   \n&lt;section class=\"section main-article-chapter\" data-menu-title=\"7.

Use secure coding methods&lt;/h2&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;When coding a new application or identifying ways to modify an existing or off-the-shelf product, apply industry standards, guidance and checklists to ensure secure coding methods and security practices. For example, consider \"&lt;a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/r5/upd1/final\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;NIST Special Publication 800-53: Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations&lt;/a&gt;\" and the \"&lt;a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;OWASP Web Security Testing Guide&lt;/a&gt;.\"&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;  \n&lt;section class=\"section main-article-chapter\" data-menu-title=\"8.

APIs typically include key attributes of an application, such as programming logic and security credentials.

Create a plan that is flexible enough to respond to a variety of security threats, and specify the roles and responsibilities of the incident response team. Schedule &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/tip/How-to-conduct-incident-response-tabletop-exercises\"&gt;incident response exercises&lt;/a&gt; to ensure the team is prepared for an event.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;  \n&lt;section class=\"section main-article-chapter\" data-menu-title=\"11.

        "title": "5 steps for a smooth SIEM implementation",
        "summary": "&lt;p&gt;Security information and event management technology has long been a cornerstone of the SOC -- collecting, correlating and centralizing security data to enable more efficient and effective threat detection and incident response.&lt;/p&gt; \n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/security-information-and-event-management-SIEM\"&gt;SIEM&lt;/a&gt; integrates with tools, services and endpoints across an organization and handles massive amounts of data, making migration a significant undertaking. The good news is that thoughtful and strategic planning can make the difference between a rocky and smooth deployment. If you've recently purchased SIEM technology or are in the process of doing so, let's examine some best practices for implementation.&lt;/p&gt; \n&lt;section class=\"section main-article-chapter\" data-menu-title=\"Key SIEM deployment steps\"&gt;\n &lt;h2 class=\"section-title\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Key SIEM deployment steps&lt;/h2&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;While every deployment is unique, the following key steps are advisable across most or all SIEM implementations.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;h3&gt;1. Design the SIEM's architecture&lt;/h3&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;The SIEM architecture includes all the supporting systems that SIEM relies upon and interacts with. In this phase, carefully consider the platform's current and future performance, resilience and security needs.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Identify and prioritize your organization's top SIEM use cases, which should inform decisions about the architecture. If you have use cases that SIEM doesn't address on its own, consider adopting additional complementary technologies or techniques. Organizations today commonly combine &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/tip/SIEM-vs-SOAR-vs-XDR-Evaluate-the-differences\"&gt;SIEM with other tools&lt;/a&gt;, such as SOAR and XDR, for example.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Note both primary and tangential costs when designing the SIEM architecture and planning its deployment. Possible unanticipated costs include the following:&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;ul class=\"default-list\"&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/definition/regulatory-compliance\"&gt;Cyber threat intelligence feeds&lt;/a&gt; the SIEM ingests.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;Migration of stored log data from the existing SIEM to the new SIEM.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;Parallel operation of the legacy SIEM and new SIEM due to a phased migration or log retention requirements.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;Long-term log data retention.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;Staff training on the new SIEM.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;Data ingestion-based pricing models, which can cause unforeseen cost increases. In the case of an unusual security event, for example, massive jumps in logging could result in skyrocketing costs.&lt;/li&gt; \n &lt;/ul&gt;\n &lt;h3&gt;2. Plan the deployment&lt;/h3&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;The planning phase can be surprisingly complex due to the volume of systems that interact with SIEM. For example, a SIEM platform must integrate with all the technologies it relies on for information, including logs, intelligence feeds, vulnerability and asset management systems, and any other technologies that provide critical inputs.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Deployment also needs to include all the technologies the SIEM itself feeds -- for example, &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/tip/Top-6-SOAR-uses-cases-to-implement-in-enterprise-SOCs\"&gt;security orchestration, automation and response&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/endpoint-detection-and-response-EDR\"&gt;endpoint detection and response&lt;/a&gt;; and other &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/incident-response\"&gt;incident response&lt;/a&gt; tools.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;If you have a legacy SIEM in place, you will also need to consider the following:&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;ul class=\"default-list\"&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;Which custom dashboards, configurations and workflows will need to migrate to ensure continuity and ensure important security alerts don't fall through the cracks.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;Whether your organization needs to retain legacy log data, such as to meet regulatory requirements or establish performance baselines. If so, determine how and where the legacy data will live -- e.g., in the old SIEM, the new SIEM or a third-party data management platform.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;Whether known or unknown users exist beyond SecOps, with use cases that could broaden the scope of migration and introduce additional challenges.&lt;/li&gt; \n &lt;/ul&gt;\n &lt;h3&gt;3. Perform a phased deployment&lt;/h3&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Rapidly switching over to a new SIEM can result in chaos and confusion, making it nearly impossible to pinpoint the cause of a given problem and fix it in a timely manner.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;It's best, therefore, to run the old and new SIEMs in parallel and gradually test and integrate more systems with the new platform. Address any glitches as they arise. Test the SIEM to gauge performance, resilience and security.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;A caveat: Running two SIEMs in production for an extended time can overload staff. Security leaders will need to balance the need for methodical deployments against efficient ones.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;h3&gt;4. Configure and tune&lt;/h3&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;SIEMs require a lot of initial manual configuration -- with constant reconfiguration over time -- to keep false-positive and false-negative alerts at reasonable levels. Create and refine rule sets and filters; tune alerts, thresholds and triggers; and develop and refine dashboards and reports to meet the organization's needs.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;h3&gt;5. Update policies, processes and procedures&lt;/h3&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Ideally, this work begins in the previous steps and concludes as SIEM nears full-production rollout. Train personnel on the use and maintenance of the new SIEM.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Karen Scarfone is a general cybersecurity expert who helps organizations communicate their technical information through written content.

The system wasn’t wrong — but the humans stopped questioning it. It took a single analyst with strong data storytelling skills to realize the oversight and prevent a full production shutdown. That’s what separates automation from understanding.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-shift-no-security-leader-can-ignore\">The shift no security leader can ignore</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When I began advising CISOs and cybersecurity leaders in critical industries, the conversations were about firewalls, audit checklists and incident response playbooks. Then automation arrived — and, soon after, artificial intelligence. Suddenly, everything we thought defined technical excellence began to evolve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, AI has become both an equalizer and a differentiator. It accelerates detection, automates response and surfaces insights we couldn’t see before. But here’s the paradox: the smarter our tools become, the more human our differentiators need to be — with AI acting as a <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-economic-potential-of-generative-ai-the-next-productivity-frontier\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">force multiplier</a> for skills like critical thinking and data fluency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s why a <a href=\"https://www.talentlms.com/research/skills-for-ai-powered-future\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">new generation of power skills</a> is emerging — the capabilities that will determine which cybersecurity professionals remain indispensable in the decade ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By 2030, nearly half of all cybersecurity tasks will be automated — but the leaders who thrive won’t be the ones coding faster. They’ll be the ones thinking deeper.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-traditional-skill-sets-are-no-longer-enough\">Why traditional skill sets are no longer enough</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>CISO action item:</strong> Run a 1-hour “AI Bias Audit” on your top 3 detection rules this quarter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ask:</strong> “What data is missing?

The real impact comes from how we interpret, communicate and apply what AI enables.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>AI doesn’t just speed up decisions — it reshapes them. When a model identifies an anomaly, we need humans who can:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Translate it into business risk,</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Challenge the model’s assumptions and</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Communicate the findings clearly to leadership.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s not a technical ability. That’s a power skill.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-5-new-power-skills-for-the-ai-era\">The 5 new power skills for the AI era</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"1-data-fluency-and-analytical-thinking\">1.

Every alert, log and anomaly is a data problem first — and a security problem second. In my consulting work, I’ve seen teams fail not because their tools were weak, but because their analysts couldn’t interpret what the data truly meant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being data fluent means questioning the data, recognizing bias in models and turning analytics into narratives that drive decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"2-risk-literacy-and-governance-intelligence\">2. Risk literacy and governance intelligence</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>AI introduces new risk categories — from algorithmic bias to model transparency and explainability. Future-ready CISOs must understand these challenges, not just from a compliance angle, but as part of strategic governance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emerging frameworks set the tone:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF 1.0)</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/11/01/2023-24283/safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. Executive Order on Safe, Secure and Trustworthy AI</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Risk literacy isn’t just about security controls — it’s about anticipating where technology, ethics and law intersect.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"3-executive-communication\">3.

The ability to write, present and simplify complex concepts — especially when dealing with probabilistic AI outcomes — determines who gets heard and who doesn’t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Effective communication is no longer “soft.” It’s strategic.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"4-cross-functional-collaboration\">4. Cross-functional collaboration</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>AI doesn’t exist in silos — and neither should cybersecurity.

But there’s a catch: AI amplifies both strengths and weaknesses.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Poor data governance → model drift</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Incomplete context → false positives</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Without ethical and human oversight → disastrous decisions</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s why building the human layer of cybersecurity — judgment, ethics and context — is now mission-critical.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For years, CISOs have been judged on the absence of incidents. But AI changes that metric. When algorithms take over detection and reporting, visibility doesn’t mean accountability. The challenge is shifting from preventing breaches to proving control — not through dashboards, but through narrative and governance. The CISO’s new dilemma is this: how do you lead when the system knows more than you do?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"building-the-future-ready-security-team\">Building the future-ready security team</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Three actions to take this quarter:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Invest in power skills — not just tools.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Perform regular skill-gap analyses that include communication, governance literacy and data storytelling.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>AI can automate tasks, but not wisdom.

        "summary": "&lt;p&gt;With the end of 2025 quickly approaching, it's time to look forward to 2026 and explore some key themes security leaders should be aware of to help focus their efforts.&lt;/p&gt; \n&lt;p&gt;In reviewing &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/opinion/Network-security-predictions-for-the-next-year\"&gt;my 2025 predictions&lt;/a&gt;, one that exceeded my expectations was Palo Alto Networks' &lt;a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/company/press/2025/palo-alto-networks-announces-agreement-to-acquire-cyberark--the-identity-security-leader\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;acquisition&lt;/a&gt; of CyberArk. In December 2024 I wrote, \"For both zero trust and SASE, integrations with identity providers are critical. Privileged access management has become a core use case for many zero-trust network access vendors. Ultimately, I could see a scenario where a network security vendor looks at the identity market and decides there's enough opportunity to take a chance.\" I'm not sure I had a $25 billion acquisition in mind when I wrote that.&lt;/p&gt; \n&lt;p&gt;So, what's in store for the upcoming year? Unsurprisingly, AI has at least a mention across all my predictions for 2026. Which isn't to say it's the only thing on the agenda, but it has become so pervasive that it will be at least a tangential consideration in most areas.&lt;/p&gt; \n&lt;p&gt;Without further ado, here are my five network security predictions for 2026.&lt;/p&gt; \n&lt;section class=\"section main-article-chapter\" data-menu-title=\"Zero trust for AI becomes a priority\"&gt;\n &lt;h2 class=\"section-title\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Zero trust for AI becomes a priority&lt;/h2&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Zero trust has shifted from a marketing buzzword to a security imperative, reinforced by reference architectures and executive orders from the federal government. Many organizations are implementing broad &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/answer/What-are-the-most-important-pillars-of-a-zero-trust-framework\"&gt;zero-trust architectures&lt;/a&gt; across their environments, but due to the complexity of these projects and the fact that zero trust is a journey and not a destination, it remains a work in progress for most.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Yet, IT innovation continues to march forward. Before most organizations have a handle on zero trust generally, they'll have to consider how to apply it to AI. This includes securing user access to public AI applications, AI model access to data sources and, most importantly, AI agent access to a variety of resources.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Identity is already a foundational pillar of zero trust, but many organizations are still working on incorporating risk- and contextual-based access models to their environments. This will be critical, especially as agentic architectures take hold and become more autonomous.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;    \n&lt;section class=\"section main-article-chapter\" data-menu-title=\"Living-off-the-land attacks become pervasive, in part due to AI\"&gt;\n &lt;h2 class=\"section-title\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Living-off-the-land attacks become pervasive, in part due to AI&lt;/h2&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/tip/How-to-prevent-living-off-the-land-attacks\"&gt;LOTL attacks&lt;/a&gt; have been an ongoing trend over the last few years, with Bitdefender reporting that 84% of the 700,000 cyberincidents it analyzed used LOTL techniques of some kind. As attackers continue to use AI and shift to agent-based attacks, the prevalence of LOTL attacks will only grow.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Detecting and mitigating these attacks will take a multilayered and coordinated effort. Network-based tools, such as microsegmentation and network detection and response, will be critical to detecting and &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/tip/Common-lateral-movement-techniques-and-how-to-prevent-them\"&gt;preventing lateral movement&lt;/a&gt;, command and control traffic, and other anomalous behavior that bypasses signature-based defenses.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;   \n&lt;section class=\"section main-article-chapter\" data-menu-title=\"Browser security heats up, but to augment, not replace existing tools\"&gt;\n &lt;h2 class=\"section-title\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Browser security heats up, but to augment, not replace existing tools&lt;/h2&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;The browser security market has garnered a lot of attention over the past couple of years. The vendor side has seen significant activity, and 2026 will see security teams invest heavily in these capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Rather than replacing existing tools, however, most teams will look at browser security as a complementary addition to the tools already in place. Part of this will be driven by the type of approaches available. SASE vendors have released browsers to extend protection to the endpoint and support AI security. Standalone secure browser extension vendors tout the flexibility of continuing to use a standard browser with more secure capabilities. Not all organizations want to deploy a new, standalone browser to all their users. But there is no question that adding greater visibility and control over activity in the browser should be on every security leader's priority list in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;   \n&lt;section class=\"section main-article-chapter\" data-menu-title=\"The AI security market begins to thin out\"&gt;\n &lt;h2 class=\"section-title\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;The AI security market begins to thin out&lt;/h2&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;This will be a continuation of a trend we saw in 2025. Most AI security companies focus on a specific AI use case, for example, securing employee use of public AI applications, defending internal AI models and AI-enabled applications, securing agentic AI architectures and using agentic architectures in the SOC. These use cases are too close to existing markets for established vendors to stand pat, and too distinct for a unified AI security approach in most cases. Add in the &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/opinion/Too-many-pointless-tools-Platformization-is-better\"&gt;trend of platformization&lt;/a&gt; and it stands to reason that large network and SaaS security vendors, application and API security vendors, identity vendors and SOC vendors will find it most feasible to acquire the capabilities they need to extend fully into AI.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;  \n&lt;section class=\"section main-article-chapter\" data-menu-title=\"SaaS security consolidation accelerates\"&gt;\n &lt;h2 class=\"section-title\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;SaaS security consolidation accelerates&lt;/h2&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Similarly, it has become harder and harder for SaaS security vendors to survive as standalone entities. We have already seen notable acquisitions by Check Point, Fortinet and CrowdStrike in this area. This is also arguably the area where AI is the cleanest extension of an existing market. Employees accessing public AI applications is extremely close to the traditional SaaS security use case -- security teams need visibility and control over what applications are being accessed, the data being shared with those applications, distinct policies for corporate instances and open instances, and more. Monitoring for malicious prompt returns and tracking content generated by these applications are more specific capabilities, but on the whole, they are similar use cases. We'll continue to see many of these capabilities be subsumed by SASE platforms.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;John Grady is a principal analyst at Omdia who covers network security.

One ship, arriving weekly, supplies orange juice used by all of the city’s major retailers. If Port Elizabeth’s systems went down tomorrow due to a cyber attack, 46 million consumers within the four-hour trucking radius would feel the impact within days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The threat is real. The recent government shutdown furloughed CISA and FEMA staff at a critical time of exposure and vulnerability. The legal framework that allowed threat intelligence sharing between government and industry? That expired on September 30th when Congress failed to reauthorize the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015. And the malware? That’s already in place, pre-positioned by nation-state actors waiting for the right geopolitical moment to trigger it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is what one might call the “perfect storm of vulnerability,” and it’s hitting US maritime infrastructure right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-evidence-isnt-theoretical\">The evidence isn’t theoretical</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In late 2024, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/seattle-airport-cyberattack-ransomware-rhysida-95cd980a9f45112f0fdce488233eec9c\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">hackers hit the Port of Seattle with ransomware</a>, demanding $6 million and releasing sensitive data on the dark web when their demands weren’t met. But the real threat extends far beyond opportunistic ransomware actors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a member of the Area Maritime Security Committee (AMSC) for Sector New York with the US Coast Guard, I see firsthand how maritime facilities are preparing for the new Title 33 CFR cybersecurity requirements that went into effect in July 2025. Some ports, like the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, have the resources and maturity to comply. They’ve been conducting penetration tests, red team exercises and tabletop drills for years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what about the other 2,300+ facilities regulated under the Maritime Transportation Security Act (MTSA)?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider SeaPort Manatee in Florida — a facility that moved 11.8 million tons of cargo in 2024, <a href=\"https://www.seaportmanatee.com/2024/11/seaport-manatee-reports-record-fiscal-2024-activity-as-hurricane-recovery-advances/#:~:text=The%20newly%20released%20economic%20impact,percent%20from%20two%20years%20earlier.\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">generating $7.3 billion in economic impact</a>. They spent $97,500 on a cybersecurity assessment in June 2024, with 75% funded by a DHS <a href=\"https://www.fema.gov/grants/preparedness/port-security\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">FEMA Port Security Grant Program</a>. That’s one facility doing it right. But while they were still recovering from Hurricane Milton damage, how many smaller facilities were scrambling to find even that level of funding?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Japan’s Port of Nagoya was hit by ransomware in 2023, originally attributed to the Russian-affiliated LockBit gang, the central computer system was compromised and cargo operations were suspended for several days. The 2021 Suez Canal blockage by the Ever Given — a physical incident, not cyber — caused an estimated $10 billion per day in stalled trade. Now imagine that disruption triggered deliberately by malware already embedded in port systems such as gantry cranes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"this-is-a-workforce-problem-not-a-vendor-problem\">This is a workforce problem, not a vendor problem</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The new regulations require all 3,000 MTSA facilities to designate a cybersecurity officer (why the Coast Guard named them CySOs and couldn’t just call them CISOs, I do not know). Finding hundreds of qualified people who understand both operational technology in maritime environments and cybersecurity is nearly impossible. Many facilities are looking at IT professionals who will require cross-training on maritime technology systems and assets with 30+ year life cycles. This is quite different from the capital expenditure write-off of a laptop every 3–5 years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Especially concerning is the fact that thousands of CISOs are considering leaving their corporate roles because they’re tired of being used as scapegoats when breaches occur. Hopefully, some are now looking for side work as part-time contractors with maritime facilities, treating it as job-loss mitigation while doing something that gives them genuine job satisfaction. If hired, they would immediately see the benefits of their work improving the security posture of a port facility in their hometown.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is our critical infrastructure protection strategy: exhausted professionals moonlighting because facilities can’t afford full-time qualified staff.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-developers-and-security-teams-can-actually-do\">What developers and security teams can actually do</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re reading this and thinking, “I don’t work at a port, why does this matter?” then consider your own supply chain dependencies. Your company most likely delivers services using third-party solutions, many of which depend on maritime logistics you never even think about. The systemic risk that emerges from complex systems means a port shutdown doesn’t just delay Amazon deliveries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the pandemic, we couldn’t get toilet paper or laptops. Our supply chains were deeply disrupted by a health crisis. Now imagine that kind of pervasive disruption triggered deliberately, with government cybersecurity staff having been furloughed at a critical moment or no legal framework to safely share threat intelligence because Congress let it expire.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Three concrete steps for this quarter:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>If you’re responsible for critical infrastructure or provide services for core supply chain systems, conduct a realistic resilience assessment of what a 72-hour maritime disruption would mean for your operations. Not a theoretical risk assessment but a practical business continuity exercise.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>For mid-sized facilities facing these requirements, budget between $20,000–$25,000 for penetration testing. Explore <a href=\"https://www.fema.gov/grants/preparedness/state-local-cybersecurity-grant-program\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">FEMA’s State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program</a> (SLCGP), though be aware these often have non-federal match funding requirements. Better yet, find ways for academia, private sector and public sector entities to collaborate, such as the <a href=\"https://www.mtsisac.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">MTS-ISAC</a>, rather than forging ahead in isolation.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If you’re a CISO considering what’s next in your career, consider that maritime facilities desperately need your expertise. This isn’t corporate security theater. This is mission-critical work protecting infrastructure that millions depend on. That you and your family depend on.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-saber-rattling-is-getting-louder\">The saber-rattling is getting louder</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The current geopolitical climate has maritime security at a heightened level of readiness for international conflict. If a nation-state wanted to discourage US intervention in some form of aggression in APAC, South America or elsewhere, the malware is already believed to be in place, ready to be triggered.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In my discussions as part of the AMSC, we workshop scenarios constantly. What counts as an incident when the MARSEC (MARitime SECurity) Level needs to be elevated from 1 to 2 for a cybersecurity threat? MARSEC Level 2 requires additional protective security measures for a period of time across nautical facilities and vessels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the kind of thing that hasn’t happened yet, but for which we train constantly. The challenge is that anything compromising safety systems in a port would trigger a shutdown of the entire port. There’s an element of systemic risk to the complex ecosystem that ports support that includes rail, trucking, shipping, fuel or, yes, that weekly orange juice delivery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The US Coast Guard has been granted fairly large powers of authority in the event of an incident. But those powers are compromised when CISA staff have been furloughed and threat intelligence sharing has lost its legal protection. We can expect asset owners and sector agencies to continue to collaborate, but they will be doing so with additional (and avoidable) risk.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"monday-morning-action-items\">Monday morning action items</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I lived in Manhattan during the first COVID lockdowns. I saw SWAT teams with sniper rifles taking up positions on rooftops across from grocery stores. That was contingency planning that thankfully didn’t need to be activated. But it revealed something crucial: Anything that threatens the ability to procure basic necessities will rapidly escalate in ways we’d rather not contemplate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The orange juice example isn’t about orange juice. It’s about what the Orange Star represents. A complex system held together by aging infrastructure that 3,000 facilities now need to better secure, with cybersecurity officers they don’t have, using grant funding that was stuck during the government shutdown, while the legal framework for threat sharing has expired and nation-state malware sits dormant in their systems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What you should do Monday morning: Elevate the discussion around cybersecurity risk with elected officials, boards of directors and everyday citizens. Accept the mantra of incident response: it’s not a matter of if, but rather just a matter of when.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As an information security professional who has worked in this industry for 30+ years and who has given birth to major ecommerce sites in the Web 1.0 dotcom bubble, building and protecting banks and critical infrastructure in the ensuing years, I am not optimistic. Do we have the gumption and grit to do what’s needed?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We must work together now with focus, conviction and verve, because the alternative is unthinkable. I mention the word “verve” because I feel there must be a creative energy to how we champion our collective resilience and how we defend our community, our democracy and our way of life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s no incident response plan for a perfect storm. Only preparation before it hits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This article is published as part of the Foundry Expert Contributor Network.<br /></strong><a href=\"https://www.csoonline.com/expert-contributor-network/\"><strong>Want to join?</strong></a></p>\n</div></div></div></div>",

Others help organizations duplicate supply chain twins for additional visibility.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;h3&gt;Cloud or on-premises deployments?&lt;/h3&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Most organizations opt for cloud-based digital twin deployments, although highly regulated industries might prefer on-premises alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;In general, cloud deployments offer scalability and flexibility, cost-effective implementation and advanced cloud security tools, while on-premises deployments offer &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/tip/Data-sovereignty-compliance-challenges-and-best-practices\"&gt;data sovereignty&lt;/a&gt;, reduced dependency on third-party providers, and more customized and stronger security controls.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;The final decision on whether to deploy digital twins on-premises or in the cloud often depends on these, as well as cost and regulatory requirements.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;           \n&lt;section class=\"section main-article-chapter\" data-menu-title=\"Security benefits of digital twins\"&gt;\n &lt;h2 class=\"section-title\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Security benefits of digital twins&lt;/h2&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Digital twins are a proactive security approach that offer significant benefits, including vulnerability identification, predictive analytics and incident response testing.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;h3&gt;Vulnerability identification&lt;/h3&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Security analysts use digital twins to identify exposures, including misconfigurations, &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterprisedesktop/tip/Use-this-10-step-patch-management-process-to-ensure-success\"&gt;missing patches&lt;/a&gt; and other potential issues. Running a simulated attack exposes these weaknesses, providing teams with the opportunity to mitigate them before malicious actors can exploit them.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;This continuous assessment adapts to changes in both the production environment and potential risks, such as zero-day vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;h3&gt;Predictive analytics&lt;/h3&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;AI-assisted digital twin deployments help identify potential attack vectors and prioritize risks to minimize exposure and structure response plans. They provide predictive analysis by combing through usage patterns and historical trends. This information could include mean time to failure, mean time between failures, mean time to detect and other similar metrics important to availability and incident response teams.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;The real time nature of a digital twin helps facilitate quicker responses and more accurate assessments.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;h3&gt;Incident response testing&lt;/h3&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Digital twins provide opportunities to test how security personnel, automated systems and AI respond to incidents.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;ul class=\"default-list\"&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Validating manual testing.&lt;/b&gt; Rehearsing responses in realistic environments, improving coordination, communication and procedures.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Validating automated testing.&lt;/b&gt; Testing automated security workflows for efficiency and effectiveness. Verifying these automated workflows helps avoid unintended consequences.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Optimizing playbooks.&lt;/b&gt; Providing actionable feedback and results to cybersecurity responders, enabling the production of &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/tip/How-to-create-an-incident-response-playbook\"&gt;more effective playbooks&lt;/a&gt;. This post-incident review improves decision-making and root-cause analysis.&lt;/li&gt; \n &lt;/ul&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Organizations can use the feedback received from incident response testing scenarios to design more effective team training and post-incident analysis for specific types of attacks.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;            \n&lt;section class=\"section main-article-chapter\" data-menu-title=\"Digital twin best practices\"&gt;\n &lt;h2 class=\"section-title\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Digital twin best practices&lt;/h2&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Carefully plan and implement digital twin deployments to reap the benefits and minimize risks. The digital twin infrastructure itself cannot become a vulnerability, and it must also accurately reflect the production environment.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Use the following insights and best practices to manage your organization's digital twin deployments:&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;ul class=\"default-list\"&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;Encrypt data transfers between production and physical twins.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;Consider phased deployments to demonstrate effectiveness and manage the project scope.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;Enforce strong access controls, including MFA and role-based access control.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;Implement threat modeling and mitigation strategies early.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;Place digital twins on isolated segments and eliminate network communications with production systems.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;Conduct continuous penetration testing to address current threats.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;Audit digital twin systems regularly.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;Ensure digital twins remain aligned with the production systems.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;Implement effective data governance and validation to ensure digital twin operations include trusted data.&lt;/li&gt; \n &lt;/ul&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Digital twins are beneficial beyond standard cybersecurity use cases. Not only do they simulate various attack scenarios, but they also provide planning and predictive maintenance information for manufacturing, supply chain and logistics planning, healthcare and training systems.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Expect digital twins to become increasingly crucial to cybersecurity practices, especially in &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/tip/IT-security-frameworks-and-standards-Choosing-the-right-one\"&gt;high-security environments&lt;/a&gt;.

In recent days, the Trump administration has taken several actions against groups it blames for cyber schemes and has outlined a strategy for a more assertive and better coordinated deterrence strategy.&lt;/p&gt; \n&lt;p&gt;Decisions from Washington this week struck some as mixed messages, however. The Federal Communications Commission voted 2-1 to &lt;a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/fcc-eliminates-telecom-cybersecurity-requirements/806052/\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;scrap cybersecurity regulations&lt;/a&gt; the Biden administration placed on U.S. telecom providers, a move that Senate Democrats said would weaken defenses against attacks, such as the &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/news/366615490/CISA-FBI-confirm-China-breached-telecommunication-providers\"&gt;2024 Salt Typhoon attack&lt;/a&gt; attributed to China-backed threat actors. Leaders at CISA, meanwhile, said they plan to make hiring a priority in 2026. Layoffs and voluntary departures have significantly affected CISA this year. Security efforts, the agency's acting director &lt;a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/cisa-hiring-workforce-strategy/805733/\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; in a recent memo to staff, are \"hampered by an approximately 40% vacancy rate across key mission areas.\"&lt;/p&gt; \n&lt;p&gt;This week's featured news examines a new U.S. cybersecurity strategy, the creation of the Scam Center Strike Force and sanctions imposed on a Russian hosting company by U.S., U.K. and Australian governments.&lt;/p&gt; \n&lt;section class=\"section main-article-chapter\" data-menu-title=\"U.S. strategy strives to deter cyberattacks from Russia and China\"&gt;\n &lt;h2 class=\"section-title\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;U.S. strategy strives to deter cyberattacks from Russia and China&lt;/h2&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;National Cyber Director Sean Cairncross outlined a new cyber strategy at the Aspen Cyber Summit, emphasizing a coordinated approach with six pillars of activity. Key focuses include countering foreign adversaries, such as Russia, China and international ransomware gangs, by imposing costs for cyberattacks, as current deterrence efforts have failed while threats become more aggressive. The aim, he said, is to make U.S. responses significant enough to deter foreign actors from continuing their malicious behavior.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;The strategy prioritizes partnering with the private sector to identify and eliminate regulations Cairncross characterized as \"burdensome,\" enabling companies to redirect resources toward protecting critical assets.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Another pillar involves growing the U.S. cyber workforce through a new initiative that unites businesses, venture capitalists and educational institutions, including the creation of a cybersecurity academy. While these priorities mirror the Biden administration's agenda, specific action items and implementation details remain unclear, with Cairncross promising a concise statement of intent and policy.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/trump-administration-national-cyber-strategy-preview-sean-cairncross-aspen/805782/\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Read the full story by Eric Geller on Cybersecurity Dive&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;     \n&lt;section class=\"section main-article-chapter\" data-menu-title=\"U.S. government takes aim at foreign scammers\"&gt;\n &lt;h2 class=\"section-title\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;U.S. government takes aim at foreign scammers&lt;/h2&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;The U.S. government has launched a collaborative Scam Center Strike Force involving representatives from the Justice, Treasury, State and Homeland Security departments to combat cybercriminal syndicates operating from Burma, Cambodia and Laos. These scam centers, primarily run by transnational Chinese organized crime groups, stole more than $9 billion from Americans in 2024 through romance scams and &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/Pig-butchering-scam-explained-Everything-you-need-to-know\"&gt;pig-butchering scams&lt;/a&gt;.

        "summary": "&lt;p&gt;Netcat is arguably the most flexible network security tool available to security administrators today, and one that is valuable for any security practitioner to have in-depth knowledge of.&lt;/p&gt; \n&lt;p&gt;Let's take a look at how to use Netcat and explore some situations where you can put it to good use.&lt;/p&gt; \n&lt;section class=\"section main-article-chapter\" data-menu-title=\"Netcat: Security's Swiss Army knife\"&gt;\n &lt;h2 class=\"section-title\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Netcat: Security's Swiss Army knife&lt;/h2&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://nc110.sourceforge.io/\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;Netcat&lt;/a&gt; is a small, lightweight tool designed to send and receive data over a network. Much like the Linux and Unix cat utilities output the content of a file to a terminal or stdout, Netcat does the same thing but over the network.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;While this sounds modest in scope, security practitioners can use it creatively and string it together with itself or other commands in surprisingly powerful ways. Consider just a few of the many possible use cases:&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;ul class=\"default-list\"&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Penetration testers.&lt;/b&gt; Netcat can serve as a testing harness for interacting directly with a listening (server) socket or even as a quick-and-dirty command-and-control interface -- e.g., &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/tip/What-reverse-shell-attacks-are-and-how-to-prevent-them\"&gt;reverse shell&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Application security specialists.&lt;/b&gt; Netcat can connect to APIs, test and interact with proprietary protocols at a low (i.e., socket) level, and help gather information during reconnaissance.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Network engineers.&lt;/b&gt; Netcat is a simple and effective tool to test connectivity between different endpoints.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Students.&lt;/b&gt; Netcat is an excellent way to learn networking fundamentals and experiment with network communications.&lt;/li&gt; \n &lt;/ul&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;The widespread popularity of Netcat boils down to the following key factors:&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;ul class=\"default-list\"&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ubiquity.&lt;/b&gt; Many Linux distributions -- whether security-focused or general-purpose --include Netcat by default.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Portable.&lt;/b&gt; If a platform has a shell and a network connection, chances are good you can run Netcat on it.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lightweight.&lt;/b&gt; The small binary can easily be transported and installed when and if needed.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Versatile.&lt;/b&gt; Netcat works seamlessly under a variety of conditions, whether over TCP or User Datagram Protocol (&lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/UDP-User-Datagram-Protocol\"&gt;UDP&lt;/a&gt;), IPv4 or IPv6. For good reason, it's often called the Swiss Army knife of network security tools.&lt;/li&gt; \n &lt;/ul&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Let's explore how the tool works in greater detail and highlight some situations where you might consider using it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;       \n&lt;section class=\"section main-article-chapter\" data-menu-title=\"How Ncat operates\"&gt;\n &lt;h2 class=\"section-title\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;How Ncat operates&lt;/h2&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Netcat operates in one of two modes: as a server -- i.e., listener -- or as a client. Both are useful depending on the context, though the latter is more commonly used. The format of an extremely basic usage scenario is &lt;span style=\"font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;\"&gt;nc &amp;lt;host&amp;gt; &amp;lt;port&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; to connect to a remote host and &lt;span style=\"font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;\"&gt;nc -l &amp;lt;port&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; to listen on a given port.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Like many command-line tools, Netcat offers a lot&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;of options. It has dozens of switches that enable you to control everything from the details of the network -- e.g., which versions of IP to support, among them TCP or UDP, timeouts, time-to-live, etc. -- and what data it sends to external commands that you can chain with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Given the large number of options -- some of which are only used in rare circumstances -- I won't cover all of them here. The following are among the most common and why you might choose them (again, this is not an exhaustive list):&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;ul class=\"default-list\"&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;\"&gt;-l&lt;/span&gt; (listen mode).&lt;/b&gt; Creates a listening socket.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;\"&gt;-e&lt;/span&gt; (execute).&lt;/b&gt; Once connected, executes a specified command.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;\"&gt;-k&lt;/span&gt; (listen upon completion).&lt;/b&gt; When using &lt;span style=\"font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;\"&gt;-l&lt;/span&gt; (listen mode), causes Netcat to listen again for a new connection when one is completed.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;\"&gt;-n&lt;/span&gt; (no DNS).&lt;/b&gt; Do not attempt to resolve addresses via &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/domain-name-system\"&gt;DNS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;\"&gt;-u&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;b&gt; (UDP mode).&lt;/b&gt; Use UDP instead of TCP for connections.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;\"&gt;-v&lt;/span&gt; (verbose output).&lt;/b&gt; Show additional information to the user -- for example, when a connection succeeds, when one fails or when a new client connects.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;\"&gt;-w&lt;/span&gt; (timeout).&lt;/b&gt; Specify a timeout value after which a connection fails. Without this, Netcat blocks until a connection is established. Note that this applies only to outbound connections and not to listening mode.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;\"&gt;-x&lt;/span&gt; (use a proxy).&lt;/b&gt; Specify a proxy to connect through. Note that other flags could be required to configure the proxy connection -- for example, if the proxy requires authentication.&lt;/li&gt; \n &lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;     \n&lt;section class=\"section main-article-chapter\" data-menu-title=\"Using Netcat\"&gt;\n &lt;h2 class=\"section-title\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Using Netcat&lt;/h2&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Let's examine how to use Netcat by exploring how to create a server connection. This is foundational to much of how it is used in the field. You could, for example, need to create a remote shell on a victim box in a &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/red-teaming\"&gt;red teaming&lt;/a&gt; context. Or, you might want to emulate the server side of a connection to test how resistant a service is to &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/iotagenda/definition/man-in-the-middle-attack-MitM\"&gt;man-in-the-middle attacks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;h3&gt;Creating a listener&lt;/h3&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;The screen capture below illustrates using Netcat (&lt;span style=\"font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;\"&gt;nc&lt;/span&gt;) to create a listening socket on port 80. I used Firefox to connect to that socket to showcase how Netcat captures and displays inbound data -- in this case, the data being sent from Firefox -- being sent to that listening socket.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;figure class=\"main-article-image full-col\" data-img-fullsize=\"https://www.techtarget.com/rms/onlineimages/netcat_image1-h.jpg\"&gt;\n  &lt;img data-src=\"https://www.techtarget.com/rms/onlineimages/netcat_image1-h_mobile.jpg\" class=\"lazy\" data-srcset=\"https://www.techtarget.com/rms/onlineimages/netcat_image1-h_mobile.jpg 960w,https://www.techtarget.com/rms/onlineimages/netcat_image1-h.jpg 1280w\" alt=\"Screenshot of creating a listening socket on port 80 using Netcat\" data-credit=\"Ed Moyle\"&gt;\n  &lt;figcaption&gt;\n   &lt;i class=\"icon pictures\" data-icon=\"z\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Create a listening socket on port 80\n  &lt;/figcaption&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"main-article-image-enlarge\"&gt;\n   &lt;i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"w\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n &lt;/figure&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Note how I ran &lt;span style=\"font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;\"&gt;nc&lt;/span&gt; as root using &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/sudo-superuser-do\"&gt;sudo&lt;/a&gt;. That's because the default behavior in most Linux and Unix environments is to require root permissions to create low -- i.e., below 1024 -- sockets. High ports -- i.e., above 1024 -- are not similarly encumbered and do not require root permission.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Unless you specify otherwise, using the &lt;span style=\"font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;\"&gt;–l&lt;/span&gt; (listen) flag causes nc to block -- i.e., wait -- until a connection is made. You can either specify no additional flags, as I've done here, for default mode or you can use the &lt;span style=\"font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;\"&gt;-k&lt;/span&gt; flag -- e.g., &lt;span style=\"font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;\"&gt;nc -lk 80&lt;/span&gt; -- to have Netcat listen for new connection attempts after each connection closes.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Now, you might think it's unlikely you'll need or want to use Netcat to mimic the behavior of a web server -- particularly an insecure one that doesn't support TLS. For the most part, that's likely true. I've used this as an example for two reasons. First, HTTP is one of the simpler network protocols out there, so it's easy to illustrate Netcat's functionality. Second, extending this functionality to other protocols is intuitive and far from useless. Not only can you examine other unencrypted protocols, but bear in mind that it's not unheard of for HTTP-only connections to be used both as clients and servers for internal traffic. This is true for legacy equipment, industrial control systems, special-purpose healthcare devices and numerous other scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;h3&gt;Establishing a client connection&lt;/h3&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Let's look at the other side of that connection: the client. Initiating a connection from a client is similarly easy to accomplish. Building on the earlier example, if you want to view the server's response to the above request from our browser, do the following:&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;figure class=\"main-article-image full-col\" data-img-fullsize=\"https://www.techtarget.com/rms/onlineimages/netcat_image2-f.jpg\"&gt;\n  &lt;img data-src=\"https://www.techtarget.com/rms/onlineimages/netcat_image2-f_mobile.jpg\" class=\"lazy\" data-srcset=\"https://www.techtarget.com/rms/onlineimages/netcat_image2-f_mobile.jpg 960w,https://www.techtarget.com/rms/onlineimages/netcat_image2-f.jpg 1280w\" alt=\"Screenshot of the client connection after creating a listening socket in Netcat\" data-credit=\"Ed Moyle\" height=\"337\" width=\"558\"&gt;\n  &lt;figcaption&gt;\n   &lt;i class=\"icon pictures\" data-icon=\"z\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;The server's response to the listening socket\n  &lt;/figcaption&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"main-article-image-enlarge\"&gt;\n   &lt;i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"w\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n &lt;/figure&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;In this example, I used a standard &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/vertical-line-vertical-slash-or-upright-slash\"&gt;Linux pipe&lt;/a&gt; -- the vertical bar operator signified by the | character -- to redirect the output of the initial command to a new command, in this case &lt;span style=\"font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;\"&gt;nc &amp;lt;host&amp;gt; 80&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;I could have opened a connection directly to the remote host. Instead, I attached the output of the listening socket to the input of the new client connection to illustrate the client connection functionality, as well as the ability to chain Netcat instances together with other commands or even with Netcat itself. This in turn means you can pipe or redirect file output to Netcat, pipe input and output between different instances and numerous other actions. This again showcases how you can use Netcat in such powerful and flexible ways.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;As an example of that, I could have constructed an HTTP request to send instead in the manner depicted below:&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;figure class=\"main-article-image full-col\" data-img-fullsize=\"https://www.techtarget.com/rms/onlineimages/netcat_image3-f.jpg\"&gt;\n  &lt;img data-src=\"https://www.techtarget.com/rms/onlineimages/netcat_image3-f_mobile.jpg\" class=\"lazy\" data-srcset=\"https://www.techtarget.com/rms/onlineimages/netcat_image3-f_mobile.jpg 960w,https://www.techtarget.com/rms/onlineimages/netcat_image3-f.jpg 1280w\" alt=\"Screenshot of sending an HTTP request connection using Netcat\" data-credit=\"Ed Moyle\" height=\"324\" width=\"560\"&gt;\n  &lt;figcaption&gt;\n   &lt;i class=\"icon pictures\" data-icon=\"z\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Sending an HTTP request in Netcat\n  &lt;/figcaption&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"main-article-image-enlarge\"&gt;\n   &lt;i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"w\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n &lt;/figure&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;This is almost exactly the same, except the origin of the request is a file on the filesystem instead of the output of another Netcat command. You can extend this concept in numerous ways. For example, you can create a command-and-control channel for use in a red team context -- watch an example of this in the companion video; with the addition of a named pipe (&lt;span style=\"font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;\"&gt;mknod&lt;/span&gt;) you could create a quick and dirty proxy server; you can send and receive in real-time the output of commands, etc. If you have experience with the Linux-Unix CLI, you can use Netcat in many powerful ways.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Used creatively, Netcat is one of the most flexible and common tools in your security arsenal. Try Netcat today to explore how it can help solve security challenges in your day to day.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;div class=\"youtube-iframe-container\"&gt;\n  &lt;iframe id=\"ytplayer-0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8d47hd__Ii8?autoplay=0&amp;amp;modestbranding=1&amp;amp;rel=0&amp;amp;widget_referrer=null&amp;amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;amp;origin=https://www.techtarget.com\" type=\"text/html\" height=\"360\" width=\"640\" frameborder=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n &lt;/div&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ed Moyle is a technical writer with more than 25 years of experience in information security.

        "title": "Guide to cloud container security risks and best practices",
        "summary": "&lt;p&gt;Cloud containers are a hot topic, especially in security. Technology giants Microsoft, Google and Facebook all use them. Google uses containers for everything it runs, totaling several billion each week.&lt;/p&gt; \n&lt;p&gt;The past decade has seen containers anchoring a growing number of production environments. This shift reflects the modularization of &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchitoperations/definition/DevOps\"&gt;DevOps&lt;/a&gt;, enabling developers to adjust separate features without affecting the entire application. Containers promise a streamlined, easy-to-deploy and secure method to implement specific infrastructure requirements and are a lightweight alternative to VMs.&lt;/p&gt; \n&lt;p&gt;Let's examine the evolution of containers and discuss why cloud container security can't be overlooked.&lt;/p&gt; \n&lt;section class=\"section main-article-chapter\" data-menu-title=\"How do cloud containers work?\"&gt;\n &lt;h2 class=\"section-title\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;How do cloud containers work?&lt;/h2&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Container technology's roots were based on partitioning and chroot process isolation developed as part of Linux. Modern containers are expressed in &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchitoperations/definition/application-containerization-app-containerization\"&gt;application containerization&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchitoperations/definition/Docker\"&gt;Docker&lt;/a&gt;, and in system containerization, such as Linux containers (LXC). Both enable IT teams to abstract application code from the underlying infrastructure as they work to simplify version management and enable portability across various deployment environments.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Containers rely on virtual isolation to deploy and run applications that access a shared OS kernel without the need for VMs. Because they hold all the necessary components -- files, libraries and environment variables -- containers run desired software without worrying about platform compatibility. The host OS constrains the container's access to physical resources, so a single container cannot consume all of a host's physical resources.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;The key thing to recognize with cloud containers is they are designed to virtualize a single application. Consider a MySQL container. It provides a virtual instance of that application and that is all it does. Containers create an isolation boundary at the application level rather than at the server level. If anything goes wrong in that single container -- for example, excessive resource consumption by a process -- it only affects that individual container, not the whole VM or whole server. It also eliminates compatibility problems between containerized applications that reside on the same OS.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Major cloud vendors offer &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchitoperations/definition/Containers-as-a-Service-CaaS\"&gt;containers as a service&lt;/a&gt;, such as Amazon Elastic Container Service, AWS Fargate, Google Kubernetes Engine, Microsoft Azure Container Instances, Azure Kubernetes Service and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Kubernetes Engine. Containers can also be deployed on public or private cloud infrastructure without the use of dedicated products from a cloud vendor.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Containers are deployed in two ways: by creating an image to run in a container, or by downloading a pre-created image, such as those available on Docker Hub. Docker -- originally built on LXC -- is by far the largest and most popular container platform. Although alternatives exist, Docker has become synonymous with containerization.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;      \n&lt;section class=\"section main-article-chapter\" data-menu-title=\"Cloud container use cases\"&gt;\n &lt;h2 class=\"section-title\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Cloud container use cases&lt;/h2&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Enterprises use containers in a variety of ways to reduce costs and improve the reliability of software. Among the most common and beneficial are the following:&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;ul class=\"default-list\"&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Microservices architecture.&lt;/b&gt; Containers are ideal for microservices-based application development, where apps are broken into smaller, independently deployable services. This improves scalability and simplifies development cycles. Kubernetes &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchitoperations/tip/Kubernetes-automation-Use-cases-and-tools-to-know\"&gt;orchestrates the deployment, scaling, and management&lt;/a&gt; of these services, enabling enterprises to deploy updates with minimal downtime.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hybrid and multi-cloud deployments.&lt;/b&gt; Containers enable cloud-agnostic portability, letting enterprises run the same workloads across AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform or on-premises without changes to the application. This supports disaster recovery, cost optimization and vendor neutrality strategies.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;DevOps and continuous integration/continuous delivery automation.&lt;/b&gt; Enterprises use containers in CI/CD pipelines to ensure consistency from development to production. Containers enable developers to test in isolated environments that mirror production, reducing bugs and streamlining integration and deployment workflows.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Legacy application modernization.&lt;/b&gt; Many enterprises use containers to refactor legacy monolithic applications into more agile and maintainable services. By containerizing older apps, organizations can incrementally modernize their infrastructure without full rewrites.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Edge and IoT deployments.&lt;/b&gt; Containers can be deployed at the edge for use cases such as IoT, manufacturing and retail. Container runtimes such as K3s (lightweight Kubernetes) help IT staff support orchestration at the edge with limited resources.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Security and policy enforcement.&lt;/b&gt; By containerizing applications, enterprises can enforce &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchitoperations/tip/Apply-policy-as-code-best-practices-to-reap-benefits\"&gt;policy as code&lt;/a&gt; using services like Open Policy Agent and manage runtime security through integrations with cloud workload protection platforms (&lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/cloud-workload-protection-platform-CWPP\"&gt;CWPPs&lt;/a&gt;) and cloud-native application protection program (CNAPP) tools.&lt;/li&gt; \n &lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;   \n&lt;section class=\"section main-article-chapter\" data-menu-title=\"Cloud containers vs. VMs\"&gt;\n &lt;h2 class=\"section-title\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Cloud containers vs. VMs&lt;/h2&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchcloudcomputing/tip/Why-should-I-use-Docker-containers-vs-VMs-for-my-cloud-apps\"&gt;Compared with VMs&lt;/a&gt;, container deployments consume only a minimal amount of resources. Unlike VMs, they don't need a full OS to be installed within the container, and they don't need a virtual copy of the host server's hardware.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Containers need only minimal resources to perform the task they were designed for -- a few pieces of software, libraries and the basics of an OS. As a result, enterprises can deploy two to three times as many containers on a server as VMs, and they can be spun up much faster than VMs.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;figure class=\"main-article-image full-col\" data-img-fullsize=\"https://www.techtarget.com/rms/onlineImages/windows_server-virtual_machines_vs_containers.png\"&gt;\n  &lt;img data-src=\"https://www.techtarget.com/rms/onlineImages/windows_server-virtual_machines_vs_containers_mobile.png\" class=\"lazy\" data-srcset=\"https://www.techtarget.com/rms/onlineImages/windows_server-virtual_machines_vs_containers_mobile.png 960w,https://www.techtarget.com/rms/onlineImages/windows_server-virtual_machines_vs_containers.png 1280w\" alt=\"Graphic explaining the differences between cloud containers and VMs\" height=\"380\" width=\"560\"&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"main-article-image-enlarge\"&gt;\n   &lt;i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"w\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n &lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;    \n&lt;section class=\"section main-article-chapter\" data-menu-title=\"Benefits of containers\"&gt;\n &lt;h2 class=\"section-title\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Benefits of containers&lt;/h2&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Cloud containers are portable. Once a container has been created, it can easily be deployed to different servers. From a software lifecycle perspective, this enables enterprises to quickly copy containers to create environments for development, testing, integration and production. From a software and security testing perspective, this ensures the underlying OS is not causing a difference in the test results.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Containers also offer a more dynamic environment. IT can scale up and down more quickly based on demand, keeping resources in check.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;   \n&lt;section class=\"section main-article-chapter\" data-menu-title=\"Challenges of containers\"&gt;\n &lt;h2 class=\"section-title\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Challenges of containers&lt;/h2&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;One downside of containers is the issue of splitting the virtualization into a lot of smaller chunks. When there are just a few containers involved, it's an advantage because the team knows exactly what configuration it is deploying and where. If, however, the organization fully invests in containers, it's quite possible to have so many containers that they become difficult to manage. Imagine &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterprisedesktop/tip/Use-this-10-step-patch-management-process-to-ensure-success\"&gt;deploying patches&lt;/a&gt; to hundreds of different containers. Without an easy process, updating a specific library or package inside a container image due to a security vulnerability can be difficult.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Container management is often a constant headache, even using systems such as Docker that aim to provide IT with easier orchestration.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;   \n&lt;section class=\"section main-article-chapter\" data-menu-title=\"Cloud container security risks\"&gt;\n &lt;h2 class=\"section-title\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Cloud container security risks&lt;/h2&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;While containers offer many advantages, they also introduce unique security risks that enterprises must address. The ephemeral and dynamic nature of containers demands a modern security approach that is proactive, automated and integrated into DevOps workflows. The following are some of the key risks that organizations should prioritize with cloud containers:&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;ul class=\"default-list\"&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Vulnerable images.&lt;/b&gt; Containers are built from images, which often include system libraries, runtime dependencies and custom code. Many enterprises use public base images from registries such as Docker Hub, which could contain unpatched vulnerabilities or malware. Organizations should scan images continuously, use signed and verified sources, and establish image allowlists to ensure all builds are secure.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Container escape.&lt;/b&gt; Containers are isolated, but not impenetrable. A container breakout occurs when a malicious actor escapes the container runtime to access the host OS. This risk is elevated if containers run with &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/tip/6-ways-to-prevent-privilege-escalation-attacks\"&gt;privileged access&lt;/a&gt; or root permissions. Mitigations include running containers as non-root users, using kernel security modules, such as AppArmor and SELinux, and deploying sandboxed runtimes, such as gVisor or Kata Containers. In cloud environments, some of these mitigation options might be difficult or impossible due to client lack of control and configuration.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Secrets exposure.&lt;/b&gt; Storing credentials, API keys or tokens inside containers or environment variables poses significant risk. If compromised, attackers could gain access to databases, cloud resources or internal assets and services. Best practices include using secret management tools, such as HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager, and avoiding hardcoded secrets in images or Git repositories.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Supply chain attacks.&lt;/b&gt; Containers are part of a broader software supply chain that includes code, images, pipelines, registries and CI/CD tooling. Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in this chain to inject malicious code or compromise deployments. Mitigation requires enforcing code signing and image integrity, using software bills of materials where possible to track dependencies, and monitoring for anomalies in build pipelines.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Runtime threats.&lt;/b&gt; Once deployed, containers remain vulnerable to attacks, including reverse shells, cryptomining malware and lateral movement in Kubernetes clusters. Security teams should deploy runtime protection tools -- most CNAPP and CWPP platforms prioritize this functionality -- to monitor system calls, container behavior, and network activity to detect and stop threats in real time.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Misconfigured orchestration.&lt;/b&gt; Misconfigurations in Kubernetes or other orchestrators are among the top container security risks. Common mistakes include exposing Kubernetes dashboards and APIs to the internet, running default or weak authentication settings and granting broad cluster roles to service accounts.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Insufficient network segmentation.&lt;/b&gt; Containers often communicate across virtual networks in a cluster. Without proper network policies, any compromised container could potentially facilitate attackers moving laterally. Enforce least privilege using Kubernetes network policies, Calico or service meshes, such as Istio, to limit connectivity.&lt;/li&gt; \n &lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;   \n&lt;section class=\"section main-article-chapter\" data-menu-title=\"Cloud container security best practices\"&gt;\n &lt;h2 class=\"section-title\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Cloud container security best practices&lt;/h2&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Once cloud containers became popular, the focus turned to how to keep them secure. Consider the following:&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;ul class=\"default-list\"&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Set access privileges.&lt;/b&gt; Docker containers once had to run as a privileged user on the underlying OS. If key parts of the container were compromised, root or administrator access could potentially be obtained on the underlying OS, or vice versa. Today, Docker supports user namespaces, which enable containers to run as specific users.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Deploy rootless containers.&lt;/b&gt; These containers add an &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchitoperations/tip/Dockers-rootless-mode-a-welcome-security-update\"&gt;additional security layer&lt;/a&gt; because they do not require root privileges. Therefore, if a rootless container is compromised, the attacker will not gain root access. Another benefit of rootless containers is that different users can run containers on the same endpoint. Docker currently supports rootless containers, but Kubernetes does not.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Consider image security.&lt;/b&gt; Pay attention to the security of images downloaded from public repositories, such as Docker Hub. By downloading a community-developed image, the security of a container cannot necessarily be guaranteed. Images can be scanned for vulnerabilities. This step can provide some assurance, but its verification processes might not be thorough enough if you are using containers for particularly sensitive applications. In this case, it would be sensible to create the image yourself to ensure your security policies have been enforced and updates are made regularly. Note, however, that company-made images are only as secure as employees make them. Proper training for those creating images is critical.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Monitor containers. &lt;/b&gt;Treat containers for sensitive production applications in the same way as any other deployment when it comes to security. If a container starts acting oddly or consuming more resources than necessary, it's easy enough to shut it down and restart it. It's not quite a &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/tip/The-role-of-network-sandboxing-and-testing\"&gt;sandbox&lt;/a&gt;, but containers provide a way to keep untrusted applications separate and unaware of other applications on the endpoint.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prioritize security threats and vulnerabilities.&lt;/b&gt; Follow container and cloud container security best practices and be aware of container security vulnerabilities and attacks. Proper deployment and management are key. Regularly scan containers to ensure images and active containers remain updated and secure.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Do not forget the security of the server hosting the containers.&lt;/b&gt; If your organization is using a cloud container provider, that company is responsible for operating, patching and hardening the service.&lt;/li&gt; \n &lt;/ul&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;One final point: Although containers are a newer technology, this doesn't mean &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/tip/10-cybersecurity-best-practices-and-tips-for-businesses\"&gt;traditional security policies and procedures&lt;/a&gt; shouldn't be applied.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Rob Shapland, Ben Cole and Kyle Johnson previously contributed to this article.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dave Shackleford is founder and principal consultant at Voodoo Security, as well as a SANS analyst, instructor and course author, and GIAC technical director.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;",

        "summary": "&lt;p&gt;Remote code execution flaws are among the most prevalent and critical vulnerabilities in software today. Some of the most high-profile cybersecurity events in history -- including the 2021 Log4Shell Log4j library vulnerability, the Apache Struts vulnerability that led to the 2017 Equifax breach and the 2014 Shellshock Bash vulnerability -- were attributed to &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchwindowsserver/definition/remote-code-execution-RCE\"&gt;RCE&lt;/a&gt; flaws.&lt;/p&gt; \n&lt;p&gt;RCE exploits aren't new -- in fact, they have existed for decades.

Meta and React teams released fixes and urged organizations to update React and Next.js versions immediately.

        "title": "Security highlights from AWS re:Invent 2025",
        "summary": "&lt;p&gt;Las Vegas this week welcomed more than 60,000 attendees for &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchcloudcomputing/conference/A-conference-guide-to-AWS-reInvent\"&gt;AWS re:Invent&lt;/a&gt;, and the message was clear: AWS wants to be the platform of choice for the agentic era. In fact, CEO Matt Garman opened the keynote describing AWS as secure, available and resilient planet-scale infrastructure that is unmatched anywhere. \"Security is priority one for us,\" he said. \"Everything is built on that foundation.\"&lt;/p&gt; \n&lt;p&gt;While AWS made dozens of announcements in areas including analytics, AI, storage, compute, migration and modernization, there were just a handful of announcements for security and compliance. However, many of the announcements have important security implications. Here is a rundown of key takeaways for security teams supporting cloud workloads.&lt;/p&gt; \n&lt;section class=\"section main-article-chapter\" data-menu-title=\"Using platform features to improve security\"&gt;\n &lt;h2 class=\"section-title\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Using platform features to improve security&lt;/h2&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Organizations use offerings from cloud service providers (CSPs) to host their workloads on state-of-the-art infrastructure so they can focus on building applications and, in the AWS re:Invent spirit, invent and innovate. For enterprises, this has meant efforts to lift and shift workloads to the cloud to reap their benefits, and efforts to use cloud platforms for new workloads, saving organizations from needing to provision hardware and computing infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Cloud services have also given rise to new generations of born-in-the-cloud companies, providing the advantages of being able to scale and innovate faster than larger companies with legacy systems and hardware. My latest research at Omdia, a division of Informa TechTarget, \"&lt;a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://research.esg-global.com/reportaction/515202132/Toc\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;The State of Cloud Security: Navigating Security Offerings from Cloud Service Providers and Security Vendors&lt;/a&gt;,\" showed how organizations are increasingly putting their production workloads in the cloud for these benefits.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;While organizations understand that under the &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchcloudcomputing/definition/shared-responsibility-model\"&gt;shared responsibility model&lt;/a&gt;, where the CSP is responsible for securing the cloud and the organization must secure what is put in the cloud:&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;ul class=\"default-list\"&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;95% believe security in the cloud is a collaborative effort between CSPs and their customers.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;93% believe that the shared responsibility model and the CSP's security features affect how well they can respond to cybersecurity incidents.&lt;/li&gt; \n  &lt;li&gt;92% believe CSPs should assist them in securing cloud workloads, although the shared responsibility model does not require them to do so.&lt;/li&gt; \n &lt;/ul&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;In fact, the research showed that 73% of organizations prefer to use security features and capabilities from CSPs. When asked what makes them prefer the tools from CSPs, 67% said the CSP solution is optimized to work with the features of the CSP.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;The security announcements at re:Invent this week address this need, using AWS features to deliver better security of workloads. New enhancements to Amazon GuardDuty Extended Threat Detection added two attack sequence findings for Amazon EC2 instances and Amazon Elastic Container Service tasks. AWS also announced updates to its cloud security posture management (&lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/Cloud-Security-Posture-Management-CSPM\"&gt;CSPM&lt;/a&gt;) tool, Security Hub, which will help organizations mitigate risk by providing more context to prioritize needed actions to protect their cloud workloads.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;The Security Hub updates aggregate and correlate signals from GuardDuty, Amazon Inspector, Security Hub CSPM and Amazon Macie, organizing them by threats, exposures, resources and security coverage. This reduces manual correlation work and helps customers quickly identify critical issues, understand coverage gaps and prioritize remediation based on severity and impact.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Security Hub only supports workloads across AWS environments, however, and most organizations use multiple CSPs. Our study found that only 8% of organizations use only one CSP. The study showed 63% of those that use multiple CSPs have a primary CSP with other CSPs for small, discrete use cases, so those primarily using AWS can use Security Hub and/or its integrations with third-party vendor solutions. But other CSPs offer CSPM tools with more multi-cloud support, including Microsoft Defender and Google Cloud Security Command Center.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;         \n&lt;section class=\"section main-article-chapter\" data-menu-title=\"Security advantages with the focus on developers using agentic AI\"&gt;\n &lt;h2 class=\"section-title\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Security advantages with the focus on developers using agentic AI&lt;/h2&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;In the industry analyst Q&amp;amp;A session, Garman said that the company has embraced the reality that most customers are multi-cloud and the need to support them, but of course, he wants customers to run the majority of their workloads on AWS. A key strategy for the company is its renewed focus on developers.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;\"AWS needs to be front of mind for developers…today with agents, AI tools, capabilities and smarts going into this generation of development, for operations and security, can turbocharge what developers can do,\" he said.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;AWS announced many exciting updates that benefit developers, especially by helping them use &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/agentic-AI\"&gt;agentic AI&lt;/a&gt;. AWS has the advantage of having the scale of data needed to successfully train models, and it can offer this to customers to enable them to deploy agents effectively. For example, the &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/news/366627853/AWS-launches-AgentCore-system-and-agentic-marketplace\"&gt;Amazon Bedrock AgentCore&lt;/a&gt; has been downloaded 2 million times since its preview five months ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;While it is exciting to be able to deploy agents to autonomously perform tasks, risk mitigation requires setting controls to set clear boundaries for their actions. AWS added Policy in AgentCore in preview mode to set policies for what agents can access and do to better protect systems and data. AWS also added AgentCore Evaluations to continuously inspect agent quality as they work, analyzing behavior, correctness, safety and to catch issues before they cause any problems.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;AWS also &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchsoftwarequality/news/366635669/AWS-AI-IDE-AgentCore-throw-down-gauntlets-for-Microsoft\"&gt;showcased Kiro&lt;/a&gt;, an agentic AI-driven integrated development environment. Inspired by vibe coding, it is used internally at AWS, enabling developers to describe what they want to build, with Kiro actively assisting in the development process and taking needed actions along the way. Amazon CMO Julia White described productivity gains that can be unlocked using Kiro, from increasing productivity by 20-30% to supercharging developer productivity by five or 10 times.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;While that increase in scale sounds daunting for security, AWS is using its advantages to supercharge security as well. It also introduced Security Agent in preview mode, which works with Kiro to continuously identify security issues and accelerate remediation across the full software development lifecycle. Features include scanning pull requests across security requirements and conducting pen testing, instead of needing separate, siloed security tools that are not well-integrated with development processes or the application lifecycle.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;AWS also announced IAM Policy Autopilot, a new open source &lt;a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/tip/How-the-Model-Context-Protocol-simplifies-AI-development\"&gt;MCP server&lt;/a&gt; that analyzes application code and helps AI coding assistants generate AWS Identity and Access Management identity-based policies. It works with Kiro and other coding assistants, such as Claude Code, Cursor and Cline. This and many of the AWS agentic AI efforts are achievable only due to the scale of data and training capabilities of AWS.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;        \n&lt;section class=\"section main-article-chapter\" data-menu-title=\"Making the case to best support AI workloads\"&gt;\n &lt;h2 class=\"section-title\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Making the case to best support AI workloads&lt;/h2&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;The complete Omdia survey results of the study showed that nearly all (99%) of organizations are currently (86%) or planning (13%) to use cloud services to host AI workloads. So, AWS is competing with hyperscalers to prove that it can best host AI workloads. Security will continue to play a key role as a differentiator. The study revealed that the top three elements of concern for the cloud-native stack are AI technology, software supply chain security and CSP infrastructure. It will be interesting to see how CSPs contribute to addressing customer challenges.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;I look forward to digging more into this in my upcoming studies. If you are evaluating solutions to address these challenges or you are a vendor in this space, I'd love to hear your thoughts on these topics.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Melinda Marks is a practice director at Omdia, where she covers cloud and application security.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Omdia is a division of Informa TechTarget.
